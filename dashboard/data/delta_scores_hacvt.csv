-60.05003044612204,neg,neg," I eagerly awaited the arrival of this new Titan after Nissan let their original version (and the Frontier/Xterra line) languish for a decade with virtually no meaningful redesigns. Nissan, shame on you! (My 2006 Xterra S is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned...) The early pics of the new Titan were concerning;  it looked like a mash-up of various other brands, and just way overdone, e.g. the ridiculous emblems on the front fenders. Still, I wanted to see the truck in person and drive the beast. When it finally arrived at a close-enough dealer, I made the trip. Talk about a let-down! This thing is an abomination. Just WAY too big for a 'tweener. Maybe it should be marketed to WWE performers, because it's so massive in every respect. Except performance. Sluggish acceleration, and despite having a price tag at or above ""real"" heavy duty trucks, it does not provide real heavy duty truck capabilities. The SV I looked at and drove had an MSRP of $55k, and the dealer wasn't going to ""move much"" off that price. Yet I could buy a RAM 2500 with the awesome Cummins 6.7 liter diesel and its 370 HP and 800 (!!) ft-lbs of torque -- for $51k after dealer markdowns. In summary, I could buy this new Titan (and I was truly a Nissan advocate, having owned five of their vehicles in the last 15 years) with less capability and unproven reliability but pay more for it, vs. a proven star heavy duty truck in the RAM mentioned. No contest. Unless Nissan cuts their pricing by $10k, I don't know why anybody would opt for the 'XD'. I would be astonished if Nissan meets their sales expectations with this XD. On the other hand, they sold what, like 12k Titans in all of 2015? (Ford sells that many F150s in a week...) Thumbs down, and a Bronx jeer to Nissan for letting their Frontier and Xterra become old and obsolete. New models should have been released several years ago, including a diesel option and better/more adjustable SEATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (and rear suspension that doesn't bottom out when rolling over obstacles like the edge of my driveway... sheesh.)",

-12.189757157874396,neg,neg," I've had my Rav4 for a year and took it to the dealer to have the transmission checked.When making a low speed turn, after braking then pressing the accelerator, the automatic transmission shifts roughly. It feels like a new driver just learning to drive a manual transmission.The dealer test drove it, identified the issue, then said that was normal and there is nothing wrong with my Rav4.Other dislikes: hard seats, brake too close to accelerator, doors sound tinny when closed, keyless ignition locks up randomly, too many lever controls on steering column (3 with wipers, lights, and cruise control)",

I was originally looking to buy a Murano and on the way out of the show room I walked by the brand new just released two weeks ago, Rogue.  Blew my socks off.  The gas mileage is unbelievable.  I get 25.6 mpg in the city.  I get well over 30 mpg on the highway. The paddle shifters on the steering wheel are very different and fun.  The pep this car has for a 4 cylinder is just incredible.  The CVT offers such a smooth ride that I forget how fast I am going sometimes because I am so used to a car shifting.   I highly recommend at least test driving one for yourself.  ",

It has great acceleration but am very disappointed with the gas mileage for this vehicle.  It seems to be on the low end of 22mpg and with a small gas tank seem to be at the gas station twice a week for a fill up.  What is even more depressing is the floor carpet in the interior.  On the drivers side the carpet is already torn by the left foot rest.  I never expected that for an owner who takes the best care of a vehicle.  It will cost lots of money to repair it.,

-12.060731981987146,neg,neg," Bought it in Sept 2015, and it was the worst decision I ever made. The interior is very cheaply made.  It has one of the worst factory stereos I have ever seen. The speaker sound goes up and down by its self, it sounds as if I put a blanket over the speakers. The nav system is just as bad. When on the phone through bluetooth it also fades in and out and the person on the other end of the phone has problems hearing. The blind spot is not good, it needs to sound an alarm when wanting to change lanes, just some little flashing lights are not enough. The LDA (lane departure alarm) system is just stupid. If you are drifting out of your lane the car should push you back not just sound an alarm. There are a lot of other things ( way too many to list) wrong with this car. For just over $30K it should be a much better car. We bought my husbands car a 2015 Chrysler 200 for about the same price and his is by far a better car for the price. I will never buy Toyota again.",

The lady I talked to was Jacenta (sp) and she told me that I did have 103,000 miles on it so they couldn't help me and hung up on me. Obviously Nissan feels that a transmission should only last 80,000 miles and if their faulty mechanics cause antifreeze to ruin your transmission they should not be held responsible. I wonder if any CEO of Nissan would take a gallon of antifreeze and dump into their transmission? That is exactly what Nissan is doing and it usually happens around the 100,000 mark from what I hear.

-56.69096013800299,neu,neg," I purchased a 2004 Nissan Maxima after extensive research as a left over in January 2005. The car was garaged 95% of the time and serviced by the dealership until the warranty expired. Traveling from South Carolina to Pennsylvania, the ABS and Brake lights illuminated. Standard brakes were still operational subsequently I drove the car to the Faulkner dealership in Harrisburg. Here the mechanics determined there was a fault code indicating an entire ABS replacement. They also found rust on the floorboards under the front wheel wells. Add this to a sunroof motor failure just days prior to the ABS brakes failing.Stranded in Harrisburg I did a little research and quickly identified a TSB on Maxima brakes. Nissan owners posted on this subject frequently as well as rust under the floorboards and sunroof failure. I shared my findings with the dealership when they called to announce the nearly 5K in repairs needed for the Maxima.The Faulkner dealership then directed me to call the Nissan Corporate Customer Assistance. I explained the situation and that the car was indeed 8 years old but had merely 60K miles most of which were highway. The interview process was consistent from the dealership to the customer service representative to the final mediator. I realized I was repeating information on the car for three days. The global narrative included;	The car received regular maintenance from the Star Nissan Dealership (I would not recommend this dealership)	The Star Nissan Group sold and maintenanced the car until warranty expiration.	The Star Nissan mechanics failed to notice any of these issues even though they had the car on the rack for 10 days repairing the air conditioning just five months prior.	I personally detailed the car four to five times a yearwashed the undercarriage as well. The day before Thanksgiving the corporate mediator, Glenda, called to announce Nissan would not be providing any repair assistance. Unfortunately, I was also very ill and lacked the energy to pursue the matter. It was essential to repair the brakes so I could make it home and get to a doctor.It is important to know that I loved this car. I selected every option and waited until I found a black on black fully loaded Maxima. This car was serviced more than any other vehicle I have owned. From the 261 lb/sqft torque to the responsive engine this car made me happy..until it didnt.As it turns out, we had a dysfunctional relationship. I gave and gave and Nissan left me sitting.

I bought Toyota Camry 2011 brand new - excellent car, great ride and very reliable. I bought  another Toyota Camry 2014 brand new- semi excellent car. Reliable but 2011 Camry was better. I am a Toyota loyalist!!!So bought another Toyota this time a 2017 RAV4.  This car is so bad and way far below from 2 Toyota Camry's that I have bought from 2011.  This is the ugliest and worst features a Toyota car that I have.  From a new owners point of view, I wish I did not buy this and I will not buy another Toyota anymore. Not recommend Toyota to my friends.Last service experience 2017 at Toyota Auto nation for my 2014 Toyota.  Just came in to replace one tire that had a punctureAt the left front tire and an oil and filter change. Seems simple for one hour job!All my four tires were still good and still had a lot of traction and treads on all my four tires. Instead I was being sold by Oscar to buy four new Michelin tires for about $755 installed.  I felt there was something fishy and untrue to what he was saying about my tires. He was very insistent to sell the new tires. Something dishonest so I declined.Instead of a mere 1 hour for an oil and filter change it took almost 3 hours and I wondered what they were doing? Oscar told me they were fixing it.  Guess what, after I declined to buy tires from Oscar, after waiting 3 hours, when I returned homeI found the left front tire that had a puncture was now in the left rear and I found the 3 other new tires that I hadHas been replaced by Toyota with 3 old tires with very minimum tire treads. What a service. What a disappointment. What a dishonesty. What a bunch of thieves. I lost sleep over it and I am sure they will deny it so what's the point of dealing with dishonest service shop.  So I went to another shop to buy all four new tires aligned and installed for only $640. I was very happy with this shop. I was very angry with Toyota and will never buy from them again.",

-75.06272153959344,neu,neg," First the good – and there is a lot of good in the i8:Looks – great looker, and people love to see this on the street. Doors – this does not get much cooler than that. Exposed carbon, electric locks, kids (and adults) go crazy with this kind of stuff.Overall lines of the car are great very futuristic and a joy to look at every day.  And the “open space airflow"" below the trunk? My wife told me three times the trunk was open when I took her out the first time. Same goes for the interior  - functional, good looking and to the point.  Lastly – do love the concept of “power on demand”. You can be chilling on battery, taking it easy and if you need to – flip it to the left and you got some serious ooooompf…. Love it.Now the rest of it:Power .. Power … Power…:The car is too slow. Well – I guess it is ok when you compare it to some regular cars but it is definitely not when I compare it to my Nissan GTR or 911 Turbo. It is a 4 second car, where it should have been a 2 second car. It is not an “economical car” – not with 18 miles of battery range (never once had it at 20 as promised), and it is not a really fast car either – not with 1.5 liter in the back. Who was BMW competing with building this? Their own M3? I don’t think the M3 folks are target buyers of this car anyways. So I do think they missed the mark here. They should have competed with the 911 Turbo, with the GTR, with the McLaren and the likes. I8 has everything going for it except the power to be a supercar except power. I don’t think I will ever use the rear seats – nor anyone else I know that would. Get them out, make some flat storage area there and put a 500+hp 6 in the back instead of the 1.5 liter. Same with the little trunk in the back – don’t need the damn thing if I can get 3 additional cylinders instead. So the verdict is – put a big 6 in the back, get 700-800hp total of the complete setup and sell it for 175-190k. As of right now – I am not going to keep it when the lease expires. Hope the next 911 turbo is a hybrid and it is done right. Reliability:Well  - standard BMW per my experience. i.e. – it will break, question is how bad. So far had it in the shop for fuel tank valve replacement. Damn thing would not let me open the fuel tank! Imagine you are coming to the gas station no battery no fuel and the cap would not open!!

I had just made it to 68,000 miles at this point and figured it would not be a problem. They informed me that the warranty had actually expired at 60,000 miles and any repairs would be at my expense. They couldn't recreate the problem so they reprogramed it thinking the check engine light was a computer glitch. 3 months later the transmission has completely failed on the car.

-27.267469439836532,neu,neg," I have waited several months to review this vehicle, waiting to have something more positive to say about it. I had low expectations when I decided to shop for a minivan.  I bought a fully loaded Sienna thinking that i would be buying the best of several bad options. I probably did, but that reflects poorly on the choices available today. I will lead with the most positive thing I have to say about it. The captains chairs in the back seat are very comfortable as back seats go. There is lots of adjustability fore and aft, allowing for a lot of leeway in the 2nd and 3rd row in terms of leg room. Even the 3rd row has reclining backs.  It is the most comfortable I’ve ever encountered and the rest of the passengers don’t have to suffer for it. But they will suffer for other reasons. The Sienna just has many ergonomic issues and just poor implementation of what other manufacturers have been doing right for over a decade. I tend to buy high end German cars, but even my old 2003 FX35 had a more functional Nav/infotainment package.  This is my 9th car with a modern nav/infotainment system.  I can think of only one that was worse. It relies almost exclusively on voice commands to run all of it. I’ve gone through the voice training exercises but it didn’t help for me. I’ve had cars with voice control for 10 yrs now but this system requires that you use it. Your passenger cannot help you out. I’ve had in car internet/WiFi in several cars since 2012, and my Toyota salesman was convincing in his claim that their cellphone based app would get me a lot of the same features. I drive a lot and use Nav heavily. I was depending on the app to serve as my seamless internet portal to provide an up to date database of POIs. I was disappointed to learn that the app/van require a sign in (username and password) ever time the car is turned on. Bluetooth calls work as you’d expect but the app log in makes it virtually useless. Prepare to use your phone for everything as though you bought a $20K car. My service manager said that he doesn’t use it either and suggested that I just use SIRI and Bluetooth it into the van’s speakers. The console is a horrible deep bin. A bin with no light, USB, or 12V socket. There is one USB slot on the dash but none in either glove box. There is a sizeable gap between the console and the dash. I still don’t know why. A sloppy purse receptacle? So if you are wanting to charge your phone you have to drape the cord across the gap to a cup holder. It’s only a matter of time before my dogs tear the whole thing out, USB slot and all. There is no convenient place to put your phone out of sight.  I was disappointed with the DVD and drop down monitor. Supposedly you can do split screen video on that wide screen. I think there is an HDMI input somewhere for it. Maybe I had a setting wrong but the dvd image was not widescreen format even though it was centered on the really wide monitor. The door armrests up front are horrible. 30 yrs later and exactly the same as my dad’s 1987 Camry. 1/4” of foam batting over a fiberboard armrest. Really uncomfortable after an hour of use. Plus, I drove my elbo through that Camry armrest eventually. :-)   The leather? on the center armrest is really cheap looking. I don’t use it for fear of destroying it before I resell the thing. The braking is alarmingly worse than my Q7 despite being1000lbs lighter. The acceleration is much worse too despite being lighter and having a much bigger V6. It does get better mileage at 20-22.5 mpg. Speaking of gas, I’m still not used to unlocking the fuel door from the inside. All of our cars since 2007 have used the same keyless entry that the doors use. My van has keyless entry but it is not connected to the fuel door. The transmission feels pretty sloppy when it’s searching for a gear sometimes. I don’t know if it’s wearing or just a poor transmission.  The weirdest issue I’ve had with it revolves around cargo. I brought 2X10s home from the hardware store. I was amazed to find that there was no handle or hook to secure the hatch, inside or out. I also transported two sheets of plywood in the van. (It was a selling point for me). My salesman told me plywood would fit and Plywood would fit in my sister’s 2006 Sienna. But I learned that my seat automatically moves all the way back when the car is put in park. I did not know this because I always have the seat all the way back. The seat pressed the plywood against the rear hatch breaking the latch.  The mechanics could not get the hatch open. I had to leave the van at the dealership, plywood still inside until they could order a new latch. $750.  Toyota would not provide a loaner because they didn’t want my two puppies in their cars. They did not have a shuttle so I had to wait 1 1/2 hrs for the parts cargo van to drive us home. Just a sad lack of customer service.",

Speaking of which, the foot-wells in front light up and can change color to suit your taste/preference, as do the doorsills ( only the 1 color there ). It is not a hot rod, nor was it meant to be, and unless hammering on it, the cvt is not that intrusive, and makes up for it in mpg. I've had no issues passing or merging, and off the line, to 30 mph, it's time is nearly identical to the 6 cyl. Murano, and about a second slower to 60. Ride itself is decent all around, as is the handling. Remote start a plus, in heat or cold conditions. Happy so far, but not a lot of miles on yet.

So Toyota had 0% financing and I went to look at Corollas. I loved the new red SE--cute and more stylish than the 2013 Civic. I test drove it and it was smaller than the Civic and rode OK, but the controls seemed a little ""cheap"" and there was not much in-dash storage for things like CDs. I ended up buying the car because I made a great deal on it. Well, 2 weeks later--I miss my Civic like CRAZY! I really feel like I tookstep down in quality and space.

27.78346906338959,neg,pos," I'll start with the positive: the car is fun to drive.  Now the negatives: There are several fatal design flaws that make ownership a real pain.  For example, the six disk changers cartridge is at the back of the glove box and only accessible from the passenger seat (with all the glove box contents emptied).  The center consoles is hard to access, provides limited space and lacks a power outlet or ipod connection.  Unexplainably, there are two power outlets for the back seat passengers.  idrive is useless.  For a simply function, like shifting the air vent from the dash to the feet, it takes a dozen clicks.

7.210687396672711,neu,pos," I previously owned the 2014 Tacoma SR5 Access Cab- a great truck that unfortunately was totaled in a recent wreck when an unlicensed driver pulled in front of me .   So off to the dealer I go to replace the 2014 with the new ""improved"" 2016 model.   On the outside, the 2016 model has become sleeker, sportier and more stylish looking- more plastic where there used to be metal- but still with the new curves and grooves built into the body it's sure to impress younger drivers.   Also on the positive side Toyota finally got rid of aerial antenna thing (always a problem for car washes and tree branches) and put the antenna on the cabin hood where it belongs.  What is most disappointing about Toyota however is the obvious attempt to ""go cheap"" on the newer models by greatly diminishing the quality of materials on the interior of this vehicle.   In particular, the seats on the 2016 model are hard and uncomfortable, whereas the 2014 model had great seats.   The glovebox- now really more of a glove ""cubbyhole"" has been greatly reduced in size and you can barely fit anything more than a couple of maps and sunglasses inside of it now.  Adding the divider shelves was poorly thought of idea Toyota.  They've eliminated the easy to use lever that used to control the side mirrors and replaced it with a flimsy piece of plastic knob thing that will surely break off when used too hastily by big handed people- much harder to adjust your side mirrors now.   On the outside the factory tires are now cheap looking Hankook tires that look more like passenger car tires than truck tires- a step down from the factory tires on the 2014 model.  While the V6 engine seems to have plenty of pep, the transmission in the automatic models seems to be slightly jerky and does not have  smooth feel to it.   Some owners have claimed to be getting mid to upper 20's in the MPG category but so far I'm only getting 20 mpg on mostly highway driving at 60 mph average.   I really hope this gets better but don't expect much.I give this truck three stars instead of 2 because of the expected and known reliability of the engine and the lifetime powertrain warranty that most dealers now provide.   It's just sad that Toyota has decided to go cheap on these trucks- while raising their prices considerably- in an obvious effort to boost profits.",

38.73876012601704,neg,pos," I have owned nine BMWs, and the 335d is by far the best all-around driver.  It gets great mileage (36-38 hwy), handling is sharp, steering is communicative (much better than newer models with electric steering), and the ride is a perfect blend between sport and luxury.  The diesel pulls strong.  It is quick.  The torque is amazing.  But maintenance is a bear.  The SES light comes on every month or two.  Invariably, it is related to the diesel pollution control.  It also seems to have a lot of problems related to the glow plugs and the glow plug control module.  Unfortunately, every time the SES light comes on you can expect to pay around $1,000-$2,000 in repairs.  And this doesn't account for the additional expense of approximately $2,000 or more for a walnut shell blast cleaning every 40k-50k miles that they don't tell you about when you purchase the car.  My wife absolutely loves driving this car (as do I), but I cannot recommend it.  The expense and hassle with all of the repairs is simply too much.  Also, be aware that if you drive a lot of short trips, the problems for this car multiply.  This diesel is made to get out and gobble up large chunks of pavement, but is ill-suited for short trips across town.",
-90.54171086437873,neu,neg," What the hell were the Tundra engineers thinking when they designed the 2014 as compared to the 2007, which had stellar, sneaky, snappy little storage compartments all over the place!?!? They took just about all of handy storage compartments out of the 2014, and added one giant, cavernous (not so useful) one to center console, and I am on the fence about going back to an older model after just spending $35K! I miss some of the old features that much. I was on the fence about the reviews for things like interior design and performance, because in all honesty, I've only owned the 2014 for a few months - I bought it used with very low miles from a dealer. I had my 2007 for almost 9 years since new and had such good luck with the mechanicals on that truck, that I wanted another one just like it - the same color - but with more bells and whistles compared to my basic 07 double cab 5.7L which was getting up there in miles - 170K.I love that the new truck has some spruced up exterior bling with the grill redesign, and I'm told that they made some updates under the hood, but not a lot. Aesthetically it looks just as sharp as my 07 and even better , and the heated leather seats are just awesome, living in Vermont as I do. The climate control is much improved, and there are so many technical additions like bluetooth and navigation system that it's like I was living in the dark ages until I got this new rig. HOWEVER, as I get to know this truck, I find myself cursing the design engineers at Toyota on a daily basis. I've counted about 7 storage spaces that have disappeared from my beloved 07 design - the change drawer in the drivers door, the extra storage compartment in the front dashboard area on passenger's side, the pockets on the back of the front seats, the storage pods on the sides of the rear doors, the ashtray had some uses even though I didn't smoke - it held my nav device, which I will still use because the new one is sort of useless for many things that my Garmin Nuvi does effortlessly. What else - oh, the handle hoist-me-up bar on the drivers side - all other passenger seats in the 14 have a handle bar to hold on to - what about the driver's side, where perhaps the driver is only 5'5"" and needs to hurl herself up to the seat, as she had for 9 years in her 07? No go, and Toyota dealer won't even install one because they said it interferes with the side bag safety system. I read on Tundratalk that it can be done, but why the heck did they make it go away in the first place??? I am so mad at them over that missing handle bar.The new truck is very comfortable, some of that is that it's a Limited model compared to my older 07 which was just more basic. I get the fancy opening rear window and tinted glass, it's a sharp truck and I love looking at it. But practically speaking for storage inside the cab? It's much worse than the 07. However, on the 2015 and 2016s, I saw that the back seat had a plastic storage compartment that lived permanently under the rear seats - I did NOT want that, so I intentionally looked for the newest model without that storage compartment since it doesn't fit my needs, and that was the 14. Another gripe is that the gas mileages actually went DOWN in the 14 - c'mon Toyota, you can do better than that!!! You are going backwards. It's the same engine I had in my 07, why did you lose mileage? Mine usually is in the 14.5 mpg anyway, regardless of where I'm driving or what speed. When I put on my truck camper, it will probably go down to 10, but at least I'll be comfortable!",
-83.29251855940856,neg,neg," Loved my first Prius, a 2007 (I think a level 3 option package - no nav, single CD, etc).  The interior package of my 2017 V (level 4) seems to have been designed by first year interns.  Prime cup holder don't hold 90% of the travel cups I have or have seen.  The power outlets went from 3 easily accessible from the front seat to two; one of which is in the back of the cargo area and not accessible at all by any normal human while riding in the vehicle. The tonneau cover is a bit oddly placed so that one needs to attach a flap to the back seats if it is to cover the whole area; problem is that the attachment only works if those seats are in a slightly reclined position. The straps are solid; guess they hadn't heard of elastic. The miles per gallon on the standard odometer setting is bizzare; constantly going up and down and in no apparent logical way.  The readings on the trip meter work fine but the main odometer reading is useless.  Oh, and the toggle to go from MPH to KM/H has been standard equipment on most vehicles since the 70s; guess it's no longer needed because it simply isn't there, although there appears to be a place for it. What, you have to go to the highest trim package for that? Or is it some other special option?  The navigation system is just OK. My 10 year Garmin was better.  This one thinks I'm off road, I guess, unless I'm zoomed in so far it only shows the next 1/4 mile of map. Not exactly handy.  (Though I really like the display on the speedometer that tells me what street I'm on.)  It also doesn't display the options I've asked for, like speed limit, unless I only have the map displayed (and sometimes not then), and of course, there's no option to have that as the primary display; you have to have something else displayed also as the default. Several other odd ""design features"" as well.  None are complete deal breakers but very disappointing.  (Oh, and what's with that backup signal?  Not new but NO ONE else has it apparently since everyone who has ridden in my Priuses (just what is the plural?) has ever encountered such a signal that can be heard ONLY inside the vehicle.)Radio is Sirius but that service is of NO use to me, offering only a couple of stations I'd listen to, but I have local ones for those genres.

-1.1474859766210557,pos,neu," I have owned several F-150s that I bought new and kept each for several years. The most recent was a 2007 F-150 XLT that I drove for 11 years with very minor repairs . I recently decided it was time for something new. I did not like the twin turbo charged V6 engines, direct fuel injection, 10 speed transmissions or aluminum bodies offered for the new F-150s. Decided to look at other makes/models. I eventually selected the Tundra with the 4.6 liter V8. This is the same size V8 that I had in the 2007 F-150. I wanted to continue driving a truck with V8 engine but wanted the fuel economy of the smaller V8. Also wanted a less complex engine and transmission. The Tundra provided for these in their base model. I've only owned the Tundra for a week. So far, I'm very pleased with it. It has most of the creature comfort items that I had in my F-150 XLT. The really big difference is the ride comfort. The F-150 had a noticeably softer ride. I'm not sure if that's just because it was older and more worn but I don't think a stiffer ride will be hard to get used to. Bottom line, after driving the Tundra +/- 500 miles in the first week, I'm very pleased with it and believe the purchase to be a good decision.",

-17.90754718039625,neu,neg," Sorry, I can't agree with the other 128i reviewers. I bought this 2013 128i used, having previously owned a 2004 330ci for 6 years. Granted, the 330ci had Premium package and the 128i is base. But the Sensatech seats and door material on the 128i look cheap, and the black shiny plastic in place of the wood grain or titanium trim is just plain tacky. The 330ci felt like a luxury vehicle. The 128i feels like an entry-level Hyundai or something. I actually just sold a Hyundai Genesis 2.0T Premium, which had keyless entry, keyless start, universal remote, moonroof, nice trim, automatic dimming mirrors and good bolstered seats. It cost about $24k new. The base 128i has NONE of those things, and cost over $33k new. Yes, the driveability is much better than a Genesis (but noticeably worse than a 330ci). The gas mileage is worse than both of these other vehicles.  Overall I'm not overly impressed with the 1 series. It feels like a step down (even with more power than the 330ci and the Genesis) and a step backwards in time. The BMW enthusiast in me wants to get rid of it as soon as possible and get a 2 series!",

I'm looking into purchasing road lamps. That should help, but it's ridiculous! Don't buy this car or any until you test-drive at nite.

In less than three years and just over 36,000 miles we have serviced the transmission 3-4 times (I've lost count), had it brought in for brake noise (screeching) at least 4 times, and just this week the bearings in both rear wheels had to be replaced. The brakes still squeal but they won't do anything about it because it isn't ""that bad."" They reconditioned the surface of the rotors, re-shimmed the pads and replaced the pads 9 months ago.  I warned them then that I knew this was only a temporary fix and that I was concerned that they would get noisy again once the warranty expires and that is exactly what has happened. A few months before that they shimmed the pads which made it better temporarily. The disk brakes on every other car I've owned have not been anywhere close to this noisy! Unless I change the pads and turn the rotors to sell it it will easily affect the value of the car and then I am only passing this problem along to the next owner.The tranny has the shakes. It has been reprogrammed, the alternator was replaced because supposedly the voltage was affecting the timing of the tranny, and most recently a vale body was replaced. The oscillation problem is better for now but my wife had it buck again last week just not as bad. Now we have a vibration at about 72-73 MPH that is reportedly ""engine harmonics"" that resonates through the body of the vehicle. None of my other cars (including the Fiat) have ever had ""engine harmonics"" ring throughout the car. Their claim that this is acceptable is ridiculous. Their competitors do not have this problem.I am highly concerned that I have more bearing issues in the future.

The carpet does wear through really fast if you take the floor mats away! The radio is of really good quality JBL speakers and has an option for phone support for calling (not for music, you need an AUX cord plug in for that).

22.51633520527548,neu,pos," Prior to my 2013 Prius I owned a Hyundai SUV that got at best 14 to the gallon. I was tired of paying and pumping gas every week. I drive a lot of city miles and wanted a more economical car. Prius had a great reputation here in the desert and so I popped by the dealership and did some damage when I first bought a used Prius C. That car was far too small and cost me a  6 grand loss to trade it in only after 1 week. But back to the current Prius. It serves it's purpose, get's good mileage and allows for parking in smaller spots. However, understandably, the components are so cheap and the car sits so low to the ground that I find myself driving with a bit of fear with all the other larger and more sturdy cars on the roads and highways. I realize a lot of this has to do with keeping the car as light weight as possible for the mileage.  All 4 tires were replaced after 3 years. The car AC leaves a very stale odor in the car. I notice that with other Toyota models as well. Stinky like dirty socks. The rear bumper corner has been detaching and popping out for the entire 4 years I have had the car. I have even had it completely replaced and it only stayed put for a short time. I have read numerous complaints about this issue. Lastly, the other disappointment is the second battery. First of all it's located in the way back where you have to lift the entire contents of the trunk to get to it. Once you get to it, it can not be replaced by a regular battery. You have to go to the dealer to purchase a new one. The worst part is, the battery gives no warning before it fails. I happen to be on vacation when it decided to die and I was lucky there was a Dealer nearby so once I had it jumped with Auto Club I headed immediately to Prius. Over 200.00 later I had my new Auxiliary battery. Would it have been too difficult to add a warning light for when the battery is getting low? What would I have done if there was no dealer within miles of where it decided to die. I imagine a huge cost to have it towed. 4 years later I think I would have gone with a different car. The only Pro for me is Mileage and low maintenance other than oil changes, tire rotation and filters, so far.",

I blame engineers that probably didn't drive this after they worked up the specs.  You should be able to make an off road that handles highway curves better.  I wouldn't buy the Tundra because the gas mileage is even worse.

It's amazing how smooth and quiet the vehicle is at highway speeds compared to the Ford Explorer and Jeep Cherokee I owned previously. Granted, the tires probably have a lot to do with that, but engine and wind noise are way lower too. Love the grunt that the 3.0 inline six delivers--it loves to rev!!  I was a little concerned about the gas mileage, but it's been a big improvement over the Explorer, getting 23 or 24 mpg for pure highway driving.

Took it in for its 10,000 mile service and the dealer (Brian Bemis in Dekalb, IL) changed the oil and rotated the tires.  When I booked the appointment I told them I needed the AC to be diagnosed.  I didn't think they would have time to fix it but I wanted to know what was wrong with it.  They made me wait 90 minutes then told me that I would have to bring it back because they didn't have time to check the AC.  90 minutes to change the oil and rotate the tires?!  No working AC on a brand new car?!  Poor dealer support, and a lemon for a brand new car.  Just stay away.  I am also seeing the low tire pressure light every 2 weeks because they put Firestone tires on the car.  These are the worst brand name tires you can get.  I hate seeing the warning light on a car with about 10,000 miles on it.  It has been a terrible ownership experience.  I will never buy another Toyota.  Update after 15 months of ownership:  Yes I still own this car because I refuse to eat the huge depreciation hit.  Resale value on these looks awful.  The rocker panels are cheap plastic and both of mine are broken.  The estimate to fix them was $2,400+.  Gas mileage is still the only good thing about this car.  I have put 46,000 miles on it.  Dealer says I need new tires.  Went in for an oil change then an hour later they told me they just rotated the tires.  Booked the oil change online at St. Charles Toyota.

The equipment failure caused me to be stranded on the highway, forcing me to have my car towed to the nearest auto repair shop, costing me $2,220 in repairs. My vehicle only had 72,720 miles when the malfunction occurred. In reaching out to I-90 Nissan in Sheffield Ohio, which is where I purchased my vehicle, the staff was friendly but deferred me to Nissan Corporate to file a claim with Consumer Affairs. Consumer Affairs denied my claim because I did not take my vehicle to an “authorized dealer”. While stranded on the highway, the last place I was thinking about taking me vehicle was to the dealer (15+ miles away) that sold me a car that had a major equipment failure in less than 5 years of owning it. The broken control arm was completely rusted out, with an unsealed hole at the top, allowing water and salt to pour in. The other control arm was rusted, with stress fractures and was on its way to break soon. Lesley at Nissan Corporate told me she stands by the quality of Nissan vehicles.

It is the most comfortable car I have ever driven. My daily car is a Lexus is350. My wife's is a G37s. Of course neither come close in any type of performance comparison but neither come close in comfort either. The first week I had the car we headed down hwy 101 & 1 to Santa Monica  that was an epic trip. But the car utterly surprised me on the way back to Sacramento as we did I5 home. I set the suspension to comfort and was utterly amazed at how comfortable the ride home was. As I got to know the car had to come to the conclusion that it is a beast in a tuxedo. Well refined and subtly luxurious, but put the setting to sport/manual mode on the tranny and take traction control off and it shows its beastly side quite wonderfully. I only have 2 picks with the car. 1. The auto high beam works only half the time. And 2. The remote controlling of the convertible roof opening works only half the time too. THAT ONE is extremely irritating when you are standing beside the car and want to drop the top so you use the remote feature. AND IT DOESNT WORK!!  For a $90,000 car that should work every time. Those are the only 2 negative experiences I have had with the car. The sound system is amazing. Really amazing. As is the heads up display and the navigation.

Overall, this Avalon is acceptable if you have few other options but I will be getting rid it within the next year and buying another GM car.",

-265.1458621629872,neg,neg," I like many took the vehicle (2017 Nissan Rouge SV cloth interior with drive side powered seat) out for a short test drive and I liked how it drove. At the time of this review (Note:I bought my vehicle on 5/18/2017 and today is 8/26/2017).  The vehicle front drivers seat ( Cloth Material power) is now putting pressure on the back of my legs causing quite of bit of discomfort/pain ( that is putting it nicely). I have tried adjusting the seat several times, In every different position it will allow me to. I have had no success in releaving my discomfort. It was suggested that I place a pillow behind me to move me forward in the seat. Yes that took the presure point off that part of my legs and now placed unto another part of my legs. Now I have taken drastic measure, I have purchased a memory foam car pillow and placed under my butt/legs in order to lift my legs away from the front of the driver seat, that is where it seems the culprit of my problem is. At the end of the seat it has a slight up swing and the foam padding has no give to it. That is what's is causing the seat to dig into the back of my legs causing me pain. I have contacted Nissan and I also went back to where I purchased it. The service dept. looked me straight in my face and said didn't you take it for a test ride before you bought. I replied yes then they said did you feel any problem on your test drive I replayed no. Their answer to me was that is how the seat is made and there isn't a thing they can do for me. I called Nissan's customer service in Tenn. The nicely spoken female on the other end of the line was from Nisan consumer reports in Tenn. She stated to me that she is not a technician and has to go on what the Mechanics at the dealership recommends. She also stated that they take all consumers reports and pass them onto the appropriate team so they can possibly improve on the vehicle. What baffles my imagination is that no one from the dealership did any research. Like take my vehicle out for a test ride to see maybe I had a defective seat or to even go look at another cars seat to compare the two. It was an immediate that is how the seat is made and there is nothing we can do. One person at the service dept. recommended I might want to find a custom reholpster maybe they can help me with my problem, but they had no one to recommend. I did my research on the reholpster and found one willing to try to help me relieve the pressure point in the seat. I was in so much discomfort that I was willing to try anything to release it. I did and it has relieve some of the problem I was having. Now at least I can drive the vehicle. So the out come of this is Basically I should have caught the problem at the test drive now I am S.O.L. I was on my own to find a solution to it. So now after my little rant I would have to say No the front Driver Seat of my 2017  Rogue is not comfortable. I have done a little more research regarding this vehicle. Their leather interior driver powered seat seems to have an added adjustment. It looks like it has a foward and backward tilt. If the cloth seat had that feature it would most likely corrected my problem. But if you buy or want leather you have to deal with all the other Bells and whistles ( which I did not want ) they shove down the consumer throat and it is not cheap. Those sticker prices of those vehicles ranged some where in the low to upper 30k. Good luck with your purchase hopefully you will have a better experience then I did singed A Unhappy Consumer. I finaly brought the car into a custom reholpster they took out the stiffness in the front of the seat replaced it with memory foam. That was a costly fix for me. After I did that I finaly got a call from the mgr of my local Nissan. he was sympathic to my problem and wanted to know what could be done for me, I explained what I did and how muc it cost me. The Mgr payed half the cost of the possible fix to my problem. I drove the car for a few days and still after all that I still felt uncomfortable. I finaly tried several memory foam pillows to sit on. I have now choosen one of them and have been sitting on it ever since. ( My friends wfe makes fun of my cushion she calls it my booster seat) It is now toerable to drive but still uncomfortable.  If I could I would trade the car in to car max and purchase a different vehicle from a different manufacture but it is not in my budgetting at the moment. Hate to say it but this was my First  purchase of a Nissan Vehicle and probably is my last time buying a Nissan too..  Today’s date is Sept. 6  2018 Nothing has changed since my last posting on here.

Cruise control should default to be on but you must actually turn it on before setting. This can be a safety hazard as when you think you set cruise and it is still off car will slow down unexpectantly. This is a design defect.  My advice would be to make turning on cruise control when you start car a habit. Gas lid open is in a spot where it is easy to open accidently.  Oil change only required every 10,000 miles with 5,000 maintenance intervals. Overall this is a great car.

-75.50443785150173,neg,neg," Our BMW i3 broke and is in the shop after only 1 week.The car is now going on 3 weeks in the shop for repair of AirBag, Restraint issues.We are being told Germany Tech is working with the USA Tech. Unbelievable a 50K car that is broke, takes this long to repair and requires the help of Germany to repair.Update since first post:Car has been in repair now 3 times, the latest as on June 2016, the check engine light is ON, Dealer says BMW Engineers are trying to find out why. The car is always broken. Funny thing, when I went to drop off my i3 for repairs, there were 2 i3's in front of me, one so bad they had to put it on a dolly to move it.Let me also point out a few of the down sides of owing this car:1. The rear doors opening in the suicide fashion are also not a very good design, especially in parking lots with other vehicles parked close by. For example, say you have a child, you need to open both the front door, then the rear. You are now trapped between two doors, you have to fight with one of the doors to keep closing then opening to get to the stroller to get your child. Also if you are shopping and need to put things in the rear seat, same thing. A REAL PAIN... Don't believe me, give it a try with cars parked on each side that hug the white stripe. Then you will wish you din't have this car.Next the rear storage is small at best, you can't fit a full size stroller in the rear. If you do have a stroller, then you have no place for groceries.Now on to the body of the car, it is really a collection of plastic parts snapped together, most are very flimsy at best, and if you really stand back and look at the car, there are at least 4 different colors on the car. Looks like an erector set gone bad. The fit is also not very good. The front gas cover is really a terrible design with the locking as the pin is at the bottom and can be easily opened. Just a waste on the lock. So many curves and design elements. A real pain to clean the outside with so many panels and shapes.Next, did I say the rear windows do not roll down. They don't and another let down.  The tires are very different and skinny, makes the car very un stable feeling when you hit a smooth bump in the road such as a railroad track crossing, you can feel the car slide. Also if it's wet outside, even worst! Please don't speed around any corners with these skinny tires. Overall, the car has many short comings and things you never think about until you have it. It was neat looking in the showroom. In the real world, this is one of the worst cars I have ever owned/leased. I can only say that my feelings around BMW is this, a HIGH PRICE for such a TERRIBLE BUILT CAR. I've learned that BMW stands for ""BUILT MORE WORST"".Would I do it again, NO!!",

-39.57289388164918,neg,neg," I've leased three BMW 550 series from 2012-2018.  The first two were pretty reliable although on one I had to have one of the injector port replaced.  In January of 2018 I leased the third, an M550i Xdrive.  It's nice looking, is pretty quick and it's fun to drive.  I took possession in the winter and around April I noticed the AC didn't cool...just blew hot air.  I took it in to the dealer who charged up the system and kept it for a week looking for leaks.  Didn't find any.  Car was returned and enjoyed great AC until late June.  Just today (June 24th) the AC went from cold air to cool and finally warm in less than an hour.  Now I have to make a long hot drive to bring the car back in to the dealer next week.  I get a loaner but it's an inferior model (except for the AC).  I've only had the car for 180 days but I'm already half way to officially being able to declare the vehicle a Lemon under Texas law.  Two other annoying things are the music connection and the wireless charging.  For music I mostly use Pandora through my iPhone X.  The connection to the car is unreliable and I generally have to restart my phone to get it to play.  I've used both the BMW app and Apple Car Play.  I definitely wouldn't recommend the $300 Car Play option.  The wireless charger is hit and miss as well.  I've used two phones that are Qi charger capable and both sometimes work in the car and sometimes don't.  They both charge perfectly on the wireless charger at home.   In summary the car drives well, but the AC and the electronics problems make the car a poor choice if you're a driver who wants his $90,000 car to work as advertised.  If you're wondering why I gave it two stars rather than one, it's because the AC problem doesn't matter in the winter.",

Overall, this truck has served me really well! It's really quick off the line, and it does require getting used to how touchy the throttle is. I spun the tires quite a bit until I got used to it. The steering inspires you to throw the truck into corners and bends, and it's nicely weighted. As far as the interior goes, it's nothing to write home about. All of the panels are hard to the touch, and I do have a sizable crack in the dashboard. The controls are very easy to get used to, and there is no learning curve at all. The two-tiered glovebox, large center console and storage under the backseat provides plenty of stuff for anything you can think of. The truck is very safe, and I always felt very safe driving it even when there was 6 inches of snow on the road. This truck is pretty bare bones even as the top trim in the technology department, as it lacks bluetooth and any usb or aux ports. The Frontier has been extremely reliable, and there have been no major issues at all. In my 10 mile roundtrip commute in mainly city driving, I'm averaging 11.7 mpg, according to the readout. This is probably the worst part about my truck, as my father's new Ram 1500 averages about 17 mpg with the Hemi V8.

I read some of the other reviews and I agree that it's not intuitive to operate and the lack of functions that can be used when moving is not good.  I have an example as to why I don't trust the navigation system.  I was 2.5 miles from home.  I know how to get there.  To show the issue let me say I compared the Toyota system to my Garmin unit, Apple Maps, and Google Maps.  All three non-Toyota devices computed the route successfully as 2.5 miles and about 6 minutes.  The Toyota wanted me to take another route which was 3.9 miles and 11 minutes.  Not good.  I pulled over to better use the controls.  The Toyota showed 2 routes (the alternate was the same as Short so I am not including that).Quick  3.9 miles  11 minutesThe voice recognition  system is also poor.  I set up the ""training"" session with the unit.  If I say ""Call Jane Doe"" and Jane Doe is not in my contacts it does not tell me that it fails.  So I have a difficult time doing voice commands.  I then contact Toyota and ask if there is a way I can disable the dashboard ""intelligence"" and talk directly to Siri.  They say, ""no:.   They add that it would be dangerous but all I have to do is push a button on my phone and it DOES understand me.Short  2.5  miles   6 minutesHow can the quickest route be 5 minutes longer than the ""short"".  The ""short"" was both less miles and less time.   The Garmin understands short to mean distance and quickest to be the fastest time.Lastly, if you have a way point (destination) you can't cancel the route, the Toyota option is to ""Delete"" it.  But you are not deleting it as it still goes into ""previous destinations"".  Just bad terminology for a navigation system.

I've only had to replace the electric-system battery (pay someone to do this; it's a nightmare on your own). Pros: Reliability, obviously.  There is also more storage space than many people realize, especially with the seats down.  Two shepherds fit comfortably in the trunk; I've made several moves with this car.  The mileage has been good, especially with Ecotopia tires.  I live in Minnesota; I averaged around ~53 mpg during the summer with them.

I like the sound system and have found the GPS adequate.  The keyless entry is surprisingly nice; I wish it had remote start.Cons:  While the car while tolerate higher speeds (65 mph +), it's obviously unenthusiastic.

A/C noisy and barely adequate when the outside temp is over 90 degrees (it;s a roomy interior and would benefit, I think, from a bigger compressor. Had to replace the behind-the-dash fan (for both heating and A/C ) at 55K. Heating: the car's ""cool"" temp setting on the dash really mean just degrees of very hot air unless the A/C is turned on. The car lacks a temp gauge and oil pressure gauge. MECHANICAL: $250 wanted by the dealer to replace rear brake shoes (drum brakes in 2012? I didn't even think to look). Cracked control arm bushings seems reasonable on a car with 60K, but using parts ordered online, I had OEM struts, rear shocks, all of the control arms, bushings, an alignment, and rear brakes replaced and installed for less than than the dealer wanted to replace the cracked bushings and install new rear brake shoes. Mileage is worse than my auto-transmission Ford Escort STATION WAGON: lucky to get 30 mpg in the Versa at 55 MPH (with cruise control) on a 300-mile flattish stretch of open highway (the wagon routinely got 33-34, and the sedan, at that speed, 34-36). City mileage is horrifying: I'm a ""gentle"" driver and am not stuck in stop-and-go traffic, but Nissan in ""city"" driving gets a remarkably low 17-18 MPG. Interesting: there is a two-mile stretch of road I can coast down, and the Escorts reached 55-60 MPH on that mild decline, but the Versa is apparently not as aerodynamic, as it settles in at about 47-48 MPH. The Versa is tall and noticeably easier to get into and out of, however. BODY INTEGRITY and TRIM: laughable. I bought the car when it was two years old, but did not expect the ""rubber"" window seals to crack and turn brown nor come away and hang down, nor the trim at the front door to come away, nor the metal panel on the body (which the door slips over) to come off. Had none of these problems with the old Escorts. The Versa is noticeably more peppy than the old Escorts, but it's not going to win many races. Factor in the depreciation . . . Ouch!

The day I drove the truck home I felt a vibration coming from what appeared to be the rear of the truck and the steering was also pulling hard to the right. I assumed these would be simple repairs. After a month in the shop the dealers did 3 front end alignments that did not change anything . Each time supposedly using new specs .They addressed the vibration by installing new tires on a new truck with 2k miles.The dealer then rotated and balanced the tires several times which did not do anything to correct the vibration.  The service supervisor at the second dealer I took it to agreed after all their work the issues have not been corrected . The dealer allowed me to drive another new titan XD PRO 4x and it did the exact  same thing my truck did. The dealer suggested I contact Nissan consumer affairs. After reading about how unhelpful Nissan consumer affairs has been I decided to get rid of the truck while I still could. I did allot of research  before I purchased this truck and chose the XD because I currently own the first generation titan and a Nissan Armada that I have been happy with. Whats truly disappointing is Nissan has to Know about these issues but has chosen not to address them. I did not want to get stuck with a lemon so I decided to trade in the Titan with 6K miles on it for a F250 .This Titan  has serious issues and the dealers have no knowledge on how to correct them.

We had mice in the battery compartment, mice in the  spare, mice in the rear seat.   Mice in the ac.   The mice were colonies.  The fought, they died, they stunk, and stunk and stunk until we had to give up the ride.   They came in though the engine cowling at the hood, under the wipers.   They chewed through the cabin filter.   We had them cleaned out by the dealership once, very expensive, and the car sanitized.   They came again, we cleaned it out ourselves and placed wire over the air intakes under the wipers (YouTube) but during the summer every time we hit a bump, you guessed it:  The smell of decaying mice through the air vents.  Finally we traded for a Subaru.  it's a much better ride but I sure do miss that 51 mpg.Finally traded that rascal for a Subaru Forester, a much better vehicle but only about 30 mpg hwy.

-44.38377488993319,neu,neg," Purchased new 2014.5 Camry SE automatic. Noticed vibration at light throttle auto trans upshifts.  Toyota has acknowledged this problem in 2012-2014 Camry automatics and has issued an LSC Limited service campaign to fix software. Took my car back to dealer at 200, 500 and 1300 miles and I keep getting the this is""normal"" story. Well, vibration at upshifts, and for several miles at low rpm when driving in the 40-50 mph range is not acceptable. Heading to arbitration as I hate driving the car. Be careful when purchasing, take a long test drive. Make sure that at low rpms doesn't shake test on a smooth stretch of road so you can tell its not just road bumps.  UPDATE  By the time arbitration was held, vibration was much improved. Arbitrator would not drive car, so he had no way of feeling what I was concerned about.  I lost and no action was taken. Now it 11,500 miles, much improved, just a slight vibration when running at low rpm 12-1500 when car is cold and is in 5th or 6th idling along at 50 mph. At this point I'll probably live with it as I do like the look and feel of the car. Used no oil between 5,000 mile oil changes . Ride is a bit harsh as it is an SE model but the lousy OEM Turanza El-400 tires may be the reason. See reviews on this tire and avoid it if you can as Toyota does use other brands on their new cars. Mileage is decent averaging 26 in a mix of city/highway with light footed driving.  The ""indicated mpg"" on the dash is 5-8% optimistic. If you compare how many miles you've driven divided by gallons used its consistently less than what the car says. My last fill car said 27.3 actual was 25.7 mpg. Toyota software is geared to make you feel good. My key like is the adjustable relatively higher seating position compared to other mid-sized cars.

I get better sound in my 2010 Sienna. I really can't recommend this model. I've complained to the dealer, but they say nothing is wrong with the car!

I walked up to my car after shopping at WalMart for 40 min. only to find that it had started up by itself, and must have been running while I was in the store with the doors locked.  Upon entering the car, a yellow caution light was flashing near the odometer.

They only try to blame the customer for their defects.UPDATE after 30 days of driving - The sound system is terrible.  My Sienna minivan had a JBL sound system which was great, but the Highlander has a cheap sound system with a horrible muffled sound.  After driving the car a little while, you will notice that the interior has many cheap parts!!  The floor ""carpet"" is actually felt, not carpet, and some of the dash has plastic parts.

-39.3893552544198,pos,neg," I bought this car new and have owned it for almost 5 years. In general the car's been great--no reliability or performance issues. It's fun to drive and comfortable, and it looks good. I've seen some comments about the CVT, but mine has worked flawlessly, with no issues whatsoever. With the 3.5L engine it has plenty of acceleration, and it handles very well. HOWEVER, I do have two things to caution about: the leather seats don't wear well; the driver's seat is already showing wear, and it shouldn't yet. The bigger issue for me is the absolutely TERRIBLE audio/navigation system. The maps simply suck--they're incomplete. Valid addresses that have been in use for years show as ""outside of boundaries""--and that's with a recent map upgrade for $149! The audio/navigation system takes forever to boot up, and since you can't enter an address while driving, you're stuck waiting with the car running while it boots before you can enter anything. The voice navigation has far too many levels of menus, and it takes too long to step through them before you can get to what you want. You can enter your own points of interest, but they get listed by proximity to your current location, not alphabetically--what idiot came up with that? I recommend this as a used car--it's been great--but if you buy one, I recommend you plan to buy a good third-party audio/nav system and replace the piece of garbage that comes with the car.",

2.399105389919896,pos,neu," We are leasing the 2015 RAV4 AWD 6A LE, replacing a  comparable 2012 RAV4.  We do a lot of long distance highway driving and find it very comfortable.  Overall it is a step improvement over the previous model and we are happy with it, though  it is no luxury  vehicle.  Of the other SUV's we considered, it was the best manufacturer's lease deal.   We've been leasing to wait for better SUV fuel economy breakthroughs.  Now that a RAV4 Hybrid is available, that is our top purchase candidate.  We considered Honda CRV, Subaru Forester, and Subaru Outback.  The much more expensive Outback was the best riding, best MPG, most luxurious , and much quieter, but we preferred the upright seating and compacter wheelbase of a true SUV.  Of the 3 true SUVs the Toyota was the quietest (both Honda and Subaru still have unacceptable highway wind noise after all these years) and smoothest handling at highway speeds.  Like its 2012 predecessor, our RAV4 was flawlessly constructed.  The engine purrs and acceleration is very smooth.  Handling is good considering the higher center of gravity and weight of an SUV (Forrester wins in this category with it's boxer engine).  In strong wind at highway speed handling is jittery due to the high profile and short wheelbase- a lot of micro steering adjustments may be required.  Mileage is decent, but not exceptional, and little better than the previous model despite the addition of an extra gear.  If I keep it under 65 mph I can handily beat the EPA highway 29 MPG rating.  However, on a recent 1200 mile highway drive at 80+/- mph, with some frantic stop and going around metro Washington DC, we averaged 27.6 mpg.  Overall I have averaged 26.1 mpg in normal driving mode, lighting up the green ECO LED most of the way.  2017 UPDATE: Just drove 1150 miles from FL to PA with several half hour traffic crawl delays, otherwise averaging 70-80 mph with average mpg of 29.5 in eco mode.I have no problem with the electronic displays and controls.  Find them useful, easy to read, and intuitive.  Backup camera with guidelines is a great feature.  Basic stereo sound is nothing special; works well with USB or music player, easy to set up blue tooth connections.    It pisses me off that Toyota doesn't include a driver lumbar support in anything but the XLE model.  Seats are fairly comfortable though better for me if I use a  Back Joy Sit Smart.  Some other areas where you now get less than in the previous model: no overhead sun glass holder, only one in-dash storage box and a useless shelf above it, less console storage, glove box does not lock, no cross bars (but a cheap after market purchase if you need it, and at least you get roof rails on the basic models unlike the CRV), no back seat fold down lever in the storage area, no VARIABLE control for intermittent wiper, no full size spare, plastic wheel covers instead of finished steel wheels.  The extra charge floor mats are very cheap, better to get something after market.  Some pluses versus 2012, ours included a rear storage cover, backup camera, the rear seat headrests can be easily folded down to improve rear view visibility, in car spare storage and upswing rear door  makes rear access much easier, better MPG feedback tools,  quieter ride.Rear visibility is excellent (much better than CRV).  However, the forward descending body side lines throw you off when trying to  align the car in a parking space.  Cannot see speedometer when driver seat position is elevated.",

-54.20290250761036,neu,neg," I purchased this car when my 19-plus year old Olds Intrigue, which was in perfect running condition, was T-boned & totaled.  I originally was interested in the Camry, but when I was told that ""for just $100 more"" I could own the Avalon, and given that the width was the same (but roomier inside) as the Camry, and just 2 in. longer, I figured this would be a no-brainer.  The ride is incredibly smooth. BUT:  visibility out the rear window is partically non-existant;  The steering is very ""soft"" and took quite some time getting used to; The built-in GPS system is TERRIBLE (""Turn right"" - doesnt specify, if there's more than one road/exit!  north or south?); Although roomy, the front seats lack desirable cushioning - on a long drive (90 miles), I found myself continously squirming in my seat; Not enough room between the console wall & accelerator pedal making my foot uncomfortable - again, on prolonged rides.  The 2018 Camry had a ""Heads-Up"" Display.  This is supposed to be a step up from the Camry, but Heads-Up Display (which is really desirble - especially since adjusting the controls demand you take your eyes off the road)  is NOT available - at all!  My almost 20 year old car, one that was heavier, also w/ a V-6 got 21-22 mph, city/ 30-32mph highway.  With all the new technology AND an ""ECO"" position, I am now getting 18 mph, city, & 23-24 mph Highway!  TERRIBLE!  Even though this is a Top-of-the-Line model, carpeting (interior and trunk) not included/ is EXTRA, as is the cargo net (three things that came with my Olds!).  Only at my insistence, did the dealer add these items - no charge- BUT: the first time I used the cargo net (basic groceries), one of the fasteners BROKE!  It was made of cheap plastic - again, not what you'd expect from a top model.  I brought the car in for repair.  The following week, the OTHER fastener BROKE!   In 51 years, I have had only 5 cars but I regret that I purchased (via Toyota financing) this car rather than lease!  At half the price, the majority (not including gas milage) of my complaints would be (somewhat) moot, but given this model and cost, I expect MUCH MORE than Toyota has designed into its ""luxury"" sedan (next step up is Lexus?).

-41.36701305161114,pos,neg," Updated to 15k Miles on it now. No new issues, still loving the car.We've now had our Rogue (our first Nissan) for 6 months and have had enough time to write a little review of her.So far, this car's been pretty darn impressive.  We test drove every small SUV/crossover before we decided on it.  The interior quality and quality of the ride really boosted the Rogue up the list.  The attention to detail throughout the cabin is amazing.  Nothing feels cheap.  The ride is quiet, comfortable and smooth.  Rough pavement is not exaggerated like a few of the others out there.  Expansion joints are undetectable. Our particular dealer offers a free lifetime warranty on the CVT for the first owner.   That eased a lot of fears of owning a CVT as they're still relatively fresh.  But we've been pleasantly surprised by the CVT.  They've come a long way!  When passing, it's quicker to adjust its ratios than I can drop a gear on a manual.  You push that throttle, you're off.  The only two things I've noticed is creeping is a bit quick.  That, and due to the nature of being steel-belt driven, you can feel slight vibration in the steering wheel if you cruise at 22 mph.  Any faster or slower, it disappears.  But other than that, it behaves much like a monorail.  Smoothly accelerates to whatever speed you desire.  Going up and down hills with cruise control is a definitely wonder.  You can watch the tach go up and down, but the speed doesn't vary even a tiny bit.  The engine is definitely audible under high throttle, as it sticks at a high RPM until you let off the throttle, there are no shift points to break up the high RPM.  It just gives it all its got until you tell it not to.  But under normal or moderate acceleration, you can hardly tell the engine is running it keeps the RPM so low.Fuel economy has been excellent, averaging around 28 mpg.Like most modern vehicles, it's a bit hard to gauge where the front-right corner of the vehicle is, especially on a tight right turn around an obstacle.  You learn the feel of it in time, but at first you're questioning how close you are to those parking lines, etc.So no issues!  Should mention they seem some pretty high quality paint on these things.  Finish is very smooth and is stunning with a coat of wax.  I really can't recommend this thing enough.  Get out there and test drive everything.  This little Rogue makes a pretty good case for itself.   And the AWD absolutely rocks in snow.",

5.089049149279504,neu,neu," 2017 Tundra SR5 TRD. Truck is two weeks old now and has several items that could use improving. Audio system / infotainment system is beyond terrible. Seriously it's the worst of any new car or truck I have ever had (and I've owned a lot). Pretty much the whole inside is blow molded plastic and cheap. Seats are flat and do not hold you whatsoever and are by no means comfortable. Lots of road noise and again the radio isn't decent enough to help out.  Gauge cluster could use extra gauges (trans temp specifically) and also other features like most vehicles from this decade have as standard. Truck is overall fair at best. I'm sure it's going to be reliable but it leaves plenty to be desired in a 2017 model year vehicle. I enjoy driving my 91 Sentra that has 260,000 miles more.",
-121.24107760063862,neg,neg," We purchased a 2013 Rogue from a local dealer. It had less than 20,000 miles and was in excellent condition. The sales person remarked that it was like new and had ""Plenty of warranty coverage left"". For the first year of ownership the vehicle was great. Last summer when driving home form the beach it suddenly lost power on the interstate. Even with the gas pedal on the floor I could only go around 60 MPH. We pulled over and grabbed lunch and filled up. I thought maybe it was simply over heating. After lunch everything seemed normal so we continued our trip home. We had no further issues during the next 9 months. Earlier this summer I was driving home on the interstate and the same issue occurred. I was in the fast lane and suddenly lost power. Once again I pulled off the freeway and re-fueled. Once again the vehicle seemed ok and I had no more issues on my trip home. Last week I was driving home from work and suddenly I lost power in traffic. I was able to pull into a parking lot safely. This time the vehicle performed as if it was a manual transmission that had been knocked out of gear. Pushing the gas pedal did absolutely nothing. I had my Rogue towed to a local dealership and waited on their response. On Monday I found out that the transmission needed to be replaced at a cost of $4,200. I also found out that my powertrain warranty was only good up to 60,000 miles. The dealership recommended I call Nissan Customer Service and plead my case. I explained my issue to a very empathetic rep and he told me I would hear something back within 24 hours. This morning I was told they would be unable to provide any assistance. She went on to tell me that if I had history of service they could consider a compromise. I told her that it was two isolated issues over the last year and both occurred after 60,000. I told her that I had researched the issue and it was a common problem with the CVT transmissions. She told me that unfortunately there was nothing they could do. I will never purchase another Nissan vehicle.",

It's not fun being on a highway at 70mph and not being able to hear people in the same car! The mpg is way worse than predicted by the window sticker, the best I got for city was 25, but highway mileage was ok at about 30. The sticker said 31 city and 34 highway.

33.022188126975834,pos,pos," I love the spunk of this car! And especially the custom colorization. Since I was purchasing the car, I purchased all of the color accents that I could. The car is a beautiful dark blue, with red accents. I get compliments on the car daily. Everyone loves the look of it and especially the color accents. I previously has a Cadillac ATS and before that a Caddy CTS. Obviously both of the Caddys road smoother. But frankly, I got tired of the exorbitant repair and maintenance bills on cars that were only a few years old. Also, there was so much technology on the Caddy's that it was constantly in the shop. One even a needed a new transmission when it was just 4 years old. So I was looking to downsize, have a car with less electronics, better mileage and just a simpler ride. The Juke is all of that and more! I can't say enough about how happy I am. I purchased it in June of 2016 and it really does get 30 mpg. And I have had no problems in the year and a half I've owned it verses the probably 8 times the Cadillac was in for service during the first year. Often, the service visits were recalls or simple technological glitches, but frankly I don't think a new car should be in the shop at all in its first few years. And that's the case with my Juke. Yes, the back seat is small, but it is typically just me and my husband and my mom and I fit in the back just fine. Yes, the trunk space is smaller than my previous car, but the seats lie down easily, so it's actually better then than before. Love, love, love it!

I got the 4runner over the Pilot because of looks but sometimes I wonder about my decision after long trips. If you drive a lot of off road and local, the 4Runner is a great choice.

-29.929525844152522,neu,neg," I bought my 2011 Juke used almost 2 years ago.  I had the timing chain replace through recall on it.  I love the way it feels when driving it seems quite responsive.  I do agree the back seat is too compact for comfortable long term travel, so if you have a growing family this isn't for you.  I do wish there was  more cargo space, but I'm used to driving full sized pick up trucks and this is my first foray into small cars.  I live in the northeast and have noticed that the door locks are not always responsive, you can't open door after shutting car down because it won't automatically unlock as it should. Same with locking it from outside, doesn't always lock when it should. My husband has taken it to work during snowstorms (he drives 38 miles one way) and exclaimed that with studded tires my ""bionic frog"" would be a tank.  He was surprisingly pleased with the awd and the way it stayed on the roads in bad weather, but had concerns for its winter performance on secondary roads.  my average mpg is around 24  disappointing since I was told the mpg would be much higher, and that was a main reason I bought it.  I do like the styling, but then again I've been told I have a quirky personality.  Everyone that knows me thinks the styling is a perfect fit for me..   I have had the tailpipe come off and of course not warrantied..the upholstery is already fading and showing wear, when I really don't use it for more than going to/from work and errands.  Don't take it on rough roads since the trim on the sides will come unbolted and is difficult to get back together, again it's supposedly a compact SUV so the roads I took it on should not have been an issue.

My uncle suggested that I reach out to Nissan Corp, well after them telling me they could not help me until it was CERTIFIED Diagnosed by a dealership they could not discuss the issue with me. I spend $100.00 to get the Certified Dealer to diagnose the problem and Nissan Corp says we are sorry you are outside of the 120,000 mile ""EXTENDED"" warranty. I am sorry but if you, ""Nissan Corp"" realize that their have been complaints on the CVT transmission to give an extended warranty, then why not do the RIGHT thing and fix my sons car.

-34.61692733422592,neu,neg," First and foremost, you will NEVER EVER see anything close to 30mpg. If the wind is pushing you from behind and you are going down a large mountain slope you may get 27. But I average close to 23 mpg highway. Maybe 24 mpg on a good day if the wind is just right.  However 50-60 mph seems to be its sweetspot, you will average 35 or better, but for whatever reason once you hit the highway doing 70+ its all over. So on that end you are better off buying something with a V-8. Power is adequate but if you want to pass somebody it takes a while. The brakes are noisey especially if it sits outside for more than 12 hours, the rotors rust up very fast, but the noise goes away after 10 minutes of driving. Had an issue with a window leak the first day of my lease. Interior is roomy, very easy to get in and out of. Older friends getting in and out of the back seat sing praises. Back seats recline which is nice and also fold down for much needed room when moving large items. Dirt and road salt seem to find its way easily under the door trim which tells me in a few years you can count on rust issues. The 4wd is nice. It does what it's supposed to. Gives you the confidence to drive in almost any driving conditon. Overall, the LE model is basic transportation. Nothing flashy. Nothing to brag about, it just gets you to your destination and back. If it truly got 30mpg, I would like it much more and I'd probably keep it, but the fuel economy is what kills it for me.",

(Not a vehicle for people who have any difficulty getting in and out of a car).  To say I was extremely disappointed is an understatement.  The dealership could do nothing about the wind noise....... we even tested one straight off the lot when I came to pick mine up from Service.  It did the same thing.  My aunt had purchased a 2015 Av Hybrid around the same time.  When I spoke with her, she said that she had not realized now noisy her 2015 Avalon was until they went on a trip in a friend's Ford F150.

Cons: (1) I’ve had a transmission problem for about 2 years now (at 60,000 miles)- I blame the Continuous Variable Transmission… the car basically stops accelerating whenever I go steadily over 65 MPH- which is really dangerous on busy highways, and has become a huge problem for me especially after I hit 90,000 miles, (2) for a 2011 car, the insides are the bare minimum- it doesn’t have USB ports or electric seat adjustments, (3) seats aren't that comfortable and backseat passengers tend to feel squished, (4) it’s a gas guzzler- it has a low MPG and a 15.9 gallon tank so I’m constantly filling it up, (5) poor driver peripheral visibility- I literally have to crane my neck to check the road because of the interesting angle of the A pillar, (6) as strange as this sounds, it has a ‘soft’ metal frame- by that I mean that any little ding on the body leaves it scratched at best, dented at worst.All in all, it’s a decent when driven as a local, low mileage car, but I drive a lot and I wouldn’t suggest it to anyone who does a lot of driving.

-111.88565193054637,neu,neg," Nice updated styling. XRS model 5-Speed manual (Canadian) with a 158hp 2.4 liter 16-valve VVT-i engine as used in the Camry, Venza, RAV4 and Scion xB/ tC. Pretty peppy and good fuel economy. Our last long trip averaged 570kms (354mi) to a tankful of 89 oc gas (87 recommended). Simple interior trim with lots of plastic, but well put together. XRS Body kit/ Rear spoiler gives bit of a performance look, but not too overpowering. Flat fold-down rear seats and folding front passenger seat for larger cargo items. 18-inch rims gives a stiffer ride, but not jarring. Radio with AM/FM/CD/Sirius XM / USB/iPod functions. 115V and 12V power taps are a good touch. ABS/TCS/EBA safety features standard.**Update - Apr 2016:**The XRS is still going strong. At 70,000kms, the engine has signs of oil burning as oil was missing about 500ml / 0.5 quart- on the last oil change. No lack of power since we first got the car. Fuel mileage seems to be the same, although I find I get better mileage by using higher octane fuel. Engine sounds and performs better on synthetic oil vs ordinary dino oil. (I just get whatever is on sale). Fit and finish (as compared to my old 2001 Corolla S-5M) is not very good.  Lots of creaks and groans inside the cabin. Toyota seems to have cheapened out on the interior as some parts do not mate well- Dash and A Pillars seems to rub and has loose-sounding clicking noise, especially when cold. Noticing LOTS of road noise. Switched from the stock 18"" XRS rims with performance tires to a stock Lexus IS 17"" rims with all season tires and ride and road noise had improved but not tremendously or as good as the older Toyota. You can notice the absence of noise dampening when at highway speeds or when driving during rain as water puddle splashes into the wheel-wells are startlingly LOUD. You can also hear the stereo on moderate volumes from the outside, again, comparing this to old Corolla. An incessant creak and clicking when cornering at normal speeds as if the driver seat is loose and did not 'lock' on, no matter which position you select. This apparently is a known issue.  Dealer did not assist here even with an Extended Warranty so I can attribute it to Toyota cheapening out on their seat supplier.  Rear hatch damper (shock) has prematurely failed. No longer goes up fully, needs to be pushed further up to avoid hitting your head on the edge.Interior gadgetry seems to be flaky and sometimes non-existent. USB / AUX inputs sometimes work, most of time it doesn't. Factory deck with XM stereo did not last very long as it started to lose volumes on certain channels.Will keep this car until it falls apart, maybe the next 10yrs. Mechanically this should be as good as any Toyota.It's an updated Corolla with additional gadgets and nannies, but I'm afraid to say, I'm driving a 'thinner' car as compared to old one.**Update - Mar 2017:**The XRS still drives tight at 88,500kms (approx 54,900mi). The nagging bits like the creaking dash / A-Pillar still occurs at cold temps. Seats still click when cornering.  I noticed upon cleaning the car that the interior part of the Moonroof Frame has rusted. I'm not talking rust spots, but flaking-off rust. The frame is disintegrating. Somehow it accumulates water / moisture and perhaps not manufactured with durability in mind. Again, this can be attributed to Toyota's parts suppliers. This issue was brought to the attention of the Service advisor who stated my Extended Warranty had expired by a month and I have to pay $700 to have the Moonroof assembly replaced.  This a known issue as reflected on Toyota owner forums and also stated verbally by the unnamed Service Advisor. USB / Aux ports stopped working with the Factory Stereo, so with that goes the existence of the steering wheel controls. Rear Brake rotors need to be replaced soon as shown by wear. Surprisingly premature as this is a manual transmission car and brakes are not used as much unless on stop and go traffic. The niceties of the new car has worn off and the only likeable thing right now is the good power-to-weight ratio of this particular model (XRS 2.4).  Fuel Economy seems to be getting a little bit better.**Update - Oct 2017:**Car just had the 96,000km service. Brakes were checked and front rotors were replaced to get rid of a groaning noise when slow braking. Had a near collision where an older couple went thru a red light and i slammed on the brakes. The EBD worked fine and stopped short of a bad collision. Car is paid off so I'm not too worried about the small niggles anymore. Any chance i can and i open it up on curves and on-ramps. So far no creaks or suspension rattles, knock on wood.  Engine still runs great and no weird noises.

The interior being the worst.  You need a PHd to work the navigation system, for real!  Most complicated and illogical system I've ever seen.  Many of the interior items have broken, due to cheap plasticky materials.  One door refuses to lock or unlock with the keyless entry system.  One of the power outlets won't work.  The tire air pressure monitor shows the tire pressures, but doesn't tell you which tire has which pressure.    The radio doesn't sound great, and the interface of the touchscreen is painfully SLOW.  Like watching paint dry, slow!  The voice for the navigation is annoying and speaks comically slow, plus you can't turn her down.  Even when you turn her volume down, she comes across at whatever volume she wants, like she has a mind of her own.  Other than a lot of road noise and the steering wheel never being centered, it drives ok.  The brakes do jerk and make noise every once in a while, I guess due to the ""charging"" thing they have.  The mileage isn't good.  I get about 20-21 on the hwy.   There are full size SUVs that get that.  I'm not sure that environmentalists have given enough thought to these hybrids.  Other than the mileage being very average, soon I'm gonna have to replace the hybrid battery.  Not only does it cost $4500 from the dealer, but where do you think these big ole batteries go when we get rid of them?  Pretty soon we are gonna have a ton of these giant acid filled boxes that present a problem for our environment.

Even with the seat at the highest point, I find the car difficult to get in and out of (I'm 58).  A friend of mine who is 55 feels the same and he's actually quite active.  Having started with a 2011 Prius, the jump to a 2016 was noticeable in terms of performance.  The acceleration is quite good and, in fact, at times, I suddenly notice I'm going much faster than what it feels like.  Comfortable seats once you are in the car.  Good sound system, but the blue-tooth phone charger (which could be SO handy) doesn't fit my IPhone 6Plus!!  Relatively bad blind spots due to the way the window is set in the hatchback (thank goodness for the backup camera), and the rear view mirror seems to get in my way also with some frequency.....not what one wants to experience.  Another beef, aside from the visibility is the low front bumper.  With my 2011 Prius and now my 2016, I have to park slightly back from the concrete car bumpers because if I do not, I scrape the underneath of my car's front bumper.  In addition, I live in a very hilly area and if I'm not going VERY slowly, I bottom out my bumper when I go downhill.  Doesn't Toyota have specs on that in order to avoid such things?  Apparently not.  In addition, the paint seems inferior.  It would take too long to go into, but they might as well have used nail-polish based on some of the things I've experienced.  Finally - I notice when it is wet, the tires slip sometimes on metal and sometimes even on thickly painted lane dividers.  Maybe all cars do this....but I don't remember experiencing it before.

At about 2-3k miles again, going to Austin for the weekend from Houston, and my low oil light come back on again. Took it back to the dealer and they added over 2 quarts of oil. I asked them why the oil consumption, and their response was it's normal. A month or two, rolls out and the Aux. Pump goes out.

When you are in the open country, where you can't find a road or a repeater tower for your cell phone, this Toyota will keep you safe and running. The only alternatives are the Jeep, the Hummer, and the Land Rover. Choosing an FJ or one of these alternatives is a matter of taste. If you can enjoy one of these, you will enjoy the others.  You like these if you enjoy feeling the road, wheel noise, driving tall, a sense of power that the roar of an engine against obstacles provides, and the outdoors. Often, I read reviews about these cars that are negative about the noise and roughness of these cars. That makes no sense. You want to feel the road when you are driving off road. The wheel noise means your tires are good for off road. The engine roars because it has such high torque.My FJ is 8 years old and has 120,000 miles. It looks and feels like new, even though I abuse it totally. It gets me through rocks, mud, sand, and marshes. On the road, it accelerates like many sport cars (0 to 60 in about 7 sec).

-2.5574430349081467,neu,neu," I chose the tundra over the  GM products I would usually buy due to toyota's reputation for quality. When you get in it you realize this truck is a Toyota in name only. It uses the same interior materials as its American counterparts and many of the mechanical bits as well. The best part of this truck is the 5.7 liter v8. It has huge torque! I never feel it doesn't have enough power when towing a heavy trailer. The engine seems mechanically noisey and has a knocking sound that permeates the cab at idle. The transmission works well but is inconsistent in when and how it shifts. No auto transfer case available. All other full size pick ups have one available. Fuel economy is horrible, 12 mpg combined 17 low speed highway 15 high speed highway.The seats are very comfortable and large enough for bigger people. The hvac control panel has a cheap look and feel to it, air comes from the panel vents at all times and can not be shut off. Closing them does not stop it, normal operation it seems. Over all this truck seems very capable of doing what it was built for, but is decidedly American in its look and feel. Time will tell if it holds up to toyotas reputation.

The push start system has no accessory mode, therefore if the engine is not running and you turn it on to use the radio, phone, DVD, etc.  The battery will drain in 15 minutes.  No indicator, no warning, just dead battery.  The dealer service departments say they have to put the car on a charger just to work on them or the battery will be dead.  The BMW answer is you have to have the engine running ""all the time"".  Forget the after engine turnoff heat, you can't use it.  Forget the DVD player that logically you can't use while driving, but you have to keep the engine running.  If you expect to use your car a lot like I do, forget it.",

Nissan is aware of the problem and it affects ALL SV,s with the Navigation Radio, and they say that this is NORMAL for this car and they will not do anything about it. Nissan states that there is no other manufacturer for the radio that will fit into the SV and there  is NO fix for the problem.Update: July 7 2016.  Nissan is sending the Regional Tech Support  to meet with me next week to listen to the radio and determine if there is anything that can be done to fix it.",
-56.47102617959422,neg,neg," I've owned the car for 6 months and the it has been in the shop for 4 months (and needs to go back). Filed a lemon law case with Nissan. Don't get me wrong I love the car - beautiful inside and out. But from day one the glass panoramic roof would pop and crack over bumps and turns... eventually the whole roof was replaced because they couldn't solve the problem. Now entire car rattles, pops and cracks. my roof isn't mounted correctly and is protruding in the back where the rear window meets it. When on the freeway the the car is extremely loud (like the window or sunroom are open) I believe it is due to the roof issues - because I don't recall this issue before the replacement of the roof. The rattling and popping is driving me insane - can't wait to get this replaced or my money back. this is my 4th Nissan in 20 years... huge fan of the brand - never had any issues with Armada, Altima and older Maxima. I have a feeling that I am in for a fight with the lemon law buy back!",
46.78952862152096,pos,pos," I have owned my 2010 BMW X5 35d for 10 months and like the car more now than ever.  The car is a pleasure to drive and gets very good mileage (about 29 mpg highway for me) for a large vehicle.  The low-end torque of the diesel makes it a fun and safe car to drive.  Some people like to hate iDrive, but in 2010 BMW fixed the main issue by adding buttons so that many features can be accessed in one step rather than navigating through menus.  This is an amazingly clean diesel. Hold your hand behind the exhaust for a while. There is no soot or smell.  Great for driving family and dogs around town and on long trips.",
-61.80100219657152,neg,neg," We purchased this used for $12 grand in 2012, it had 91k on it.  More than we could afford, but we had hoped it would last and be worth it in the long haul.  Here we are four years and 30,000 miles later selling it for $500 due to a transmission issues that comes and goes, and since the problem comes and goes our mechanic is unable to diagnose the problem.  In the past four years we have had to repair or replace wheel bearings, the ABS sensor, front control arm, 3 ignition coils, spark plugs, and a brake caliper.  Right now the car needs a catalytic converter and an engine mount, but since we are done throwing money at this lemon I am not having those repaired and will be very upfront about the cars issues to whomever takes it off our hands.  The transmission has been acting up on and off for over two years, it is a very odd problem where it acts like it is slipping, and then a day or two later is 100% fine.  Since it is so intermittent there is little the mechanic can do.  Even he is frustrated with the car at this point, and he is making money off of it!Annoying things that we didn't try to repair to not waste even more money include the automatic sliding door being glitchy, sometimes it almost closes and then reopens, lots of fun in the rain or freezing winter weather.  However, if something is actually in the way of the sliding door (like me trying to put the baby in his seat) and it is closed by accident THEN it suddenly won't stop and does its best to squish you.  The console cracked early on.  The CD player doesn't work.  The handle covers for the rear seats cracked.  The vents fall out from the ceiling regularly.  There is some odd leak in the trunk that we were never able to pinpoint, so at this point we just make sure to not put anything in the back so that the water can evaporate and not get moldy.  It kills me because we really wanted to like this car.  It has plenty of room for us and our three kids and a haul from Costco.  If the grandparents want to come with us and the kids we can all fit in one car. But after dumping thousands in frequent and expensive repairs I just can't recommend this car to anyone.",

We purchased the limited, black exterior with tan interior.  Our sequoia has everything except for nav and dvd.  Things we love: interior roominess- we can fit two carseats, and a full sized adult in the second and third rows.  This never happened in our old suv.  All three rows recline.  In the second row, each seat moves individually.  So if the middle person wants to recline, they can do so without bothering the other two riders.

-45.713973133887976,neg,neg," If you're considering buying this car, please look into the N64 customer care program for this car. There are about 20 engine components that were essentially recalled. Depending on when, or if, your 550i went through this program will determine the number of components you may have had replaced. Initially, BMW changed out these components, one at a time and each time you had a check engine light come on the would replace the next most commonly malfunctioning part. Eventually, they started flat out replacing all the components since they would eventually fail (I believe due to the heat and pressure they are placed under with the twin turbo.  This added up to owners paying for their vehicle while they spent months in the shop. While BMW did cover the costs of the replacement and extend the warranty, having engine issue undoubtedly will lead to transmission issues. This was the case of the most recent 550i owner I met at an German auto shop while getting another vehicle pre purchase inspected. He said he spend over 10k on transmission work and eventual replacement while he owned the vehicle for only 6 months, 2 of those months was spent in the shop. These repair costs were not covered by BMW.   Some sleazy owners, will not mention this program/issue at all to you when selling the car (which was what happened in my case). Luckily the deal fell through in the 11th hour at the bank when the vehicle failed state inspection (due to worn out tires and brakes in this case). Owner claimed that both tires and brakes were replaced within the last 6 months. Some owners and used car salesmen are doing whatever they can to u load these problematic vehicles. Buyer beware!!!",

-51.49809576117741,neg,neg," The things that am disappointed in with the ""Toyota Highlander are:     (1) Getting in and out of the car is very difficult as I am constantly hitting my head when entering the car.   (2) Wind noise is very high especially on the passenger side and my dealer says nothing can be done to help.  (3) The seat belt alarm is VERY irritating and loud.  (a warning is fine but constant loud noise makes me dislike this car).   (4) The car is very hard to program and much too hard for me to even begin to explore the options available.    (5) I cannot find any way to have more than one cell phone connected at a time, so I am unable to have both my phone and my wife's phone connected (one or the other at a time).   (6) The feature that shuts down the engine while at a stop light is very agitating and should be a option to either always on or always off.  Lastly I would like to comment on the dealership.  I was very disappointed in the dealer in my city as I felt like I was being forced into buying things I did not want to buy and almost (should have) walked out during the finance meeting.   Over all, because of the road and wind noise, along with the difficulty getting in and out of the car, I would not recommend this car.",

I regret having purchased the car because of the blind spots.",
-87.92877780612662,neu,neg," Don't get me wrong, my Nissan Pathfinder has literally been a valued member of my family for 10 years. It has transported my family very well, and she has only put me down on the side of the road (in another state, mind you) once. I have had to have numerous and costly repairs, though, but I did give her a run for her money in commuting and travel miles. I would buy another one of these (at a price at which I could afford the fixes) because of its durability, safety, nice look, spacious cargo area once third row of seats is folded down, family friendliness and powerful engine. Here's the ugly: The transmission/radiator issue (cost me $2,500) mentioned by others is very real, as are the issues with constant brake repairs (my second or third set of rotors and pads) and O2 sensors (cost me $500)/catalytic converters (I'm scared to find out how much that is going to cost me, but the repairman's facial expression said it all as he recommended another mechanic to fix it). I also had a problem with my battery cables corroding (fixed that a couple times) and a tire going up and down (but I changed out the rims & tires, which was a costly fix for that problem). The cigarette lighters I use for my phone charger never really worked right (one may have a blown fuse, other seems to have a short). The front seats are very uncomfortable, my leg seems to rest against the bulky side of the center console. And I didn't realize how difficult the steering was until I drove other cars and nearly oversteered because of the ease. These things have aggravated and maybe even help lead to aches, pains and even a wrist surgery I've had (I spend a lot of time in my car). It's a great car if you get it at a good price that takes into account that you'll need to replace the transmission, 02 sensor and cats at some point.",
-14.674830277315777,neg,neg," This is the most aggravating vehicle I can recall ever driving. I've had it for three months now and very much regret buying it. Overall, it's a very good SUV but the transmission/drivetrain is a failure. The 8-speed transmission is uncertain and unpredictable at lower speeds (less than 30 mph). It hesitates, stalls, downshifts, and does whatever else it decides to do without any warning or sense of purpose. We live in Washington, DC, and driving in stop-and-go traffic in this Highlander is frustrating and dangerous since we don't know what it will or will not do when we need it to go now! I drive a lot of rental vehicles and have never experienced anything this bad; in fact, the 1996 Nissan Pathfinder I gave up for this was far, far smoother. It does have the automatic stop/start (which I really like -- they've had that in Europe for a long time), but the issues I describe are with the vehicle already running. I brought it to the dealership and the service department did a road test -- said it checked out normal and there were no outstanding service bulletins. As much as we love our Prius V, this Toyota is a huge disappointment.",

Bought this truck for the rugged off road looks and sport utility features.  Now it's just a sexy piece of crap. I really liked driving it-the 6 speed manual is great, and the horsepower was outstanding, until it started leaking like a sieve.  My kids and I were really upset over having to give it up.
