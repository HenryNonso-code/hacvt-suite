21.95690974063774,pos,pos, Bought new from my local dealer in March 2002.  The vehicle is the SE model and has been a real value.  This was the last year Toyota built the 4Runner for American sales solely in Japan.  That is a real plus!  Great in the snow and fun to drive on vacation.  Overall a great value and would do it over again.,
16.848585833405195,neu,pos," Here's to the new $40K BMW Corolla, or should they just be embarrassed to even put the BMW symbol, which is (really, was) the symbol of ""fun to drive""?!The pick-up in this car is jet-like, but that's where it ends. It handles like a Corolla. The interior is cheap and outdated, like a Corolla. This car handles like, you guessed it, a Corolla. It even has the same engine note as the Toyota Corolla. Everything about this car says ""Toyota""! Except of course for the gorgeous exterior.The ridiculous introduction of electronic-assisted steering will prove to be the beginning of the end for BMW. I don't wonder anymore why Audi is advertising ""more drivers than ever are switching over from BMW""!",
-3.783568175576079,neg,neu," This is the first time I have ever written a review on any product I have bought, but felt strongly enough to hopefully sway others to be careful in their purchase. I bought my pathfinder in February with 21,000 miles. I specifically asked the salesman about prior transmission issues with pathfinders and was told it was completely resolved.  At 31,000 miles it's at the dealership with catastrophic failure of the transmission. I'll get it back on Monday and trade for a new vehicle.  There will never be a Nissan parked in my driveway again.  I have no confidence in their ability to build a reliable vehicle.  The ride was good.  The interior fit our family needs.  It is a mechanical nightmare. ",
3.8814015439390914,neu,neu," Researched several brands before purchasing Frontier.  Looked to be the  best value for the money.  Fit and finish were tight  with no apparent problems.  Interior entry is difficult for tall or large frame people.  Seating is comfortable on short and long trips. Interior is sparten with lots of vinyl.  Only one recall for crash sensor in front due to corrosion.  Rear box is functional with the spray-on bed liner, lock down hooks and bed extender are a complete loss for our usage. Tires make a lot of road noise which permeates thru cabin area, but is manageable.  Brakes have been a major disappointment on this vehicle, both in stopping and replacement (22000) much to premature for 25k trk",
-83.29251855940856,neg,neg," Loved my first Prius, a 2007 (I think a level 3 option package - no nav, single CD, etc).  The interior package of my 2017 V (level 4) seems to have been designed by first year interns.  Prime cup holder don't hold 90% of the travel cups I have or have seen.  The power outlets went from 3 easily accessible from the front seat to two; one of which is in the back of the cargo area and not accessible at all by any normal human while riding in the vehicle. The tonneau cover is a bit oddly placed so that one needs to attach a flap to the back seats if it is to cover the whole area; problem is that the attachment only works if those seats are in a slightly reclined position. The straps are solid; guess they hadn't heard of elastic. The miles per gallon on the standard odometer setting is bizzare; constantly going up and down and in no apparent logical way.  The readings on the trip meter work fine but the main odometer reading is useless.  Oh, and the toggle to go from MPH to KM/H has been standard equipment on most vehicles since the 70s; guess it's no longer needed because it simply isn't there, although there appears to be a place for it. What, you have to go to the highest trim package for that? Or is it some other special option?  The navigation system is just OK. My 10 year Garmin was better.  This one thinks I'm off road, I guess, unless I'm zoomed in so far it only shows the next 1/4 mile of map. Not exactly handy.  (Though I really like the display on the speedometer that tells me what street I'm on.)  It also doesn't display the options I've asked for, like speed limit, unless I only have the map displayed (and sometimes not then), and of course, there's no option to have that as the primary display; you have to have something else displayed also as the default. Several other odd ""design features"" as well.  None are complete deal breakers but very disappointing.  (Oh, and what's with that backup signal?  Not new but NO ONE else has it apparently since everyone who has ridden in my Priuses (just what is the plural?) has ever encountered such a signal that can be heard ONLY inside the vehicle.)Radio is Sirius but that service is of NO use to me, offering only a couple of stations I'd listen to, but I have local ones for those genres. Reception quality is the worst I've had in a radio for at least 28 years (since I've lived in current location). Never had static before, now have it all the time in my location.",
-23.085536133280357,neg,neg," 2 months after warranty was over (oh yeah!), check engine light went on (P2727) with less than 50k miles. Ended up changing both the torque converter and solenoids as well as the sensor to get rid of the light... 10 miles later, the light went off again... They're telling me now that the computer has issues which has to be changed. I don't know whom to trust and what to do next. Will trade in my car for another car which won't be a Toyota for sure.... Yep, Toyota's legendary reliability is only good until you're covered under warranty... My advice to you if you decide buy a Toyota, add an extended warranty...",

52.395548977640146,pos,pos, I have always wanted an M3 since I was a kid. After owning a normal 3-series it was time for fun. I first drove the new 2008-2010 M3 with V8 and while it looks nice and very luxurious it was too soft for a performance car. I then drove the E46 M3 and was blown away by the incredible performance! It's fast as Porsche at half the cost and twice the ability to use as a normal daily driver and more useful. So I bought a perfect 2006 BMW M3 with competition package. The stopping power of the M3 brakes are incredible and blow away most other cars. I am not a fan of the newer iDrive and fortunately this car does not have it.,

-13.19180258333779,neu,neg," I have owned my Sienna XLE since April 2010 and have enjoyed it except for the rattling that developed shortly after I purchased it.The right rear passenger door panel is loose and the door and second row seats rattle when driving on all but the smoothest roads.The van has been in for repair of this issue six times at two dealerships, with no satisfactory resolution. As with all my four previously owned Toyota vehicles, I have had no mechanical problems with the Sienna. I have always had a great deal of confidence in Toyota products, but if this issue isn't resolved I probably will sell or trade the van.Not sure I would purchase another Toyota product.",
-33.24436943229898,neg,neg," I purchased my 2012 Nissan Juke new and have loved the look, feel and reliability of this vehicle until a few days ago.  I have taken care of the vehicle and have lower than average miles on it.  The warrant only covers 3 years and the turbo assembly now needs to be replaced.   This part should last the life the vehicle, not simply until after the warranty expires.   I was told that the turbo assembles are back ordered because it is a common problem with Jukes, which makes me question the quality of workmanship on this vehicle.  If I will need to replace the turbo assembly every 4 years at $2,200-$2,500, this vehicle will have to go!  I would not recommend purchasing one unless you have that kind of money at your fingertips every 4 years and don't mind parting with it.  Reliability is a big concern for me.  I purchased a new car so I wouldn't have to be concerned about costly repair bills or that my vehicle will shut down on me while driving causing a safety issue.  Apparently, I chose the wrong make and model.",
-33.30462503255637,neu,neg," We brought the car for its great fuel economy and nothing else. The car isn't cute, the ride is not what we were used to but we knew that. We test drove the Prius many times before buying it.  But during our first long distance trip (400 miles) we experienced handling problems.  The car wanted to move from side to side, I was constantly adjusting the wheel. There were also cross winds during part of the trip, which made things worst.  Spoke to  my local Toyota Service department and corporate Customer Service, they indicated the car was ""Working as designed"". My wife refuses to use the Pruis for long distance highway driving. ",

-12.668336736732954,neu,neg," I am disgusted with this, my 2nd Camry, and my 3rd Toyota. The MPG was advertised as 24 city, 34 HWY. I have NEVER gotten better than 17 mpg and sometimes get 15/16. I've taken it to Toyota and all I get is a recommendation for a $500 tuneup. I have religiously followed instructions for maintenance, and have treated it with care, but I'm going to sell it. My Dodge minivan with 110K miles gets better mileage. I bought the silly thing mainly because I wanted better mileage, and it was a replacement for my '95 Camry which, even after 120K miles, got 24 mpg. Pathetic.  Plus, the cup holder in the front doesn't work: it's not adjustable and the slim plastic tab keeps popping out.   A lemon.",

Was under warranty so I took it to the dealer. The dealer started the car listened to it for 5 min & then told me the engine had oil sludge. Told them no way it had sludge. I called nissan consumer affairs. They paid for my rental & repairs. took the engine apart-no sludge-engine was bad. I needed a new longblock engine for the car. The new engine they ordered was cracked so they ordered another one. Bottom line it took 3 wks to get my car back. Hope this engine last longer then the last one. ",
-26.957270635442057,neg,neg, That the CVT transmissions are junk. You can only buy rebuild kits through Nissan for $5400 parts only. Not including labor to remove and replace or rebuilding. Quotes through a private mechanic starts at $6300. Nissan has an abundant amount of re-manufactured transmissions for $3800 + labor. Makes one wonder if Nissan is trying to cover them selves for a civil suite following a recall.,
-22.61084635249108,neu,neg," We were very excited to buy the X5, it had stellar safety ratings and was fun to drive.  The problems started shortly after we bought it.  First the lights didn't work right.  Then the AC had problems.  We had to replace several window motors.  I got to be on a first-name basis with my service rep, as we have been in the shop almost every other month since we bought it. The quality of the materials in the vehicle was poor as well, the door handles are cheap plastic.  All in all, not a very pleasant experience with what we thought was a quality German brand. ",

With only 23,000 miles driven, the list of mechanical and electrical problems I have experienced are too numerous to mention.  Suffice it to say that this car and the BMW service from the dealer where the car were purchased have provided me with the worst car ownership experience I have ever had.  Although born in Germany, I will never purchase another German made car - Japanese cars are simply far superior - an imperceptible loss in performance is worth the peace of mind of knowing you own a reliable, well built machine.",

I mean the owner's manual doesnt even fit in the glove box.Only Im luke warm about is the initial clutch engagement aka the friction point. It is very high on the clutch pedal and the window from friction point to full engagement is the smallest Ive ever felt. This is the stock clutch. The clutch is very linear as well, so you really need to feel when it bites at first.But there is a cheap fix for it, which is buying a clutch helper spring to replace the OEM one.Better fix is a new clutch assembly which makes it feel like any other car you have driven.",

I also bought a 2002 Altima brand new (loved it). Two weeks ago the transmission started slipping between 2 and 3rd gear and it would downshift when I let up on the gas.

The CD player went out twice and I always had problems with the heat going out in winter and ac in summer. I was very optimistic about the car but around 150k it just started having continuous problems. The power steering line leaked, the radiator and thermostat went bad and every sensor in the world seems to go bad annually( and it is over 200+ to fix each, 5 different ones have went out).

Like one of the reviews, you really can't see past 100-150 feet ahead of you and going faster than 60mph....is tough when you're not familiar with the roads unless you are following someone! I'm looking into purchasing road lamps. That should help, but it's ridiculous! Don't buy this car or any until you test-drive at nite. And the car was steering and pulling like when you're on the frwy in those grooves....even when you're not. Talk about increasing the play of the traction/steering when you're in the rain on the freeway! No time to relax and drive.....had to take the car into Mossy for them to repair and they couldn't figure it out and Temecula Nissan was able to correct the issue.  Don't ask what it was as I forget sadly but I'm sure the mister remembers. Each car is like a kid, even tho they come from the same parents just like twins, they are all different so be sure to test drive the car you want to buy before buying and test drive at nite too on a road/frwy you aren't familiar with and read the reviews.  You'd swear the poor visibility of my headlights was due to the plastic cover being 10 years old and needs polishing but that's NOT the case.

-27.267469439836532,neu,neg," I have waited several months to review this vehicle, waiting to have something more positive to say about it. I had low expectations when I decided to shop for a minivan.  I bought a fully loaded Sienna thinking that i would be buying the best of several bad options. I probably did, but that reflects poorly on the choices available today. I will lead with the most positive thing I have to say about it. The captains chairs in the back seat are very comfortable as back seats go. There is lots of adjustability fore and aft, allowing for a lot of leeway in the 2nd and 3rd row in terms of leg room. Even the 3rd row has reclining backs.  It is the most comfortable I’ve ever encountered and the rest of the passengers don’t have to suffer for it. But they will suffer for other reasons. The Sienna just has many ergonomic issues and just poor implementation of what other manufacturers have been doing right for over a decade. I tend to buy high end German cars, but even my old 2003 FX35 had a more functional Nav/infotainment package.  This is my 9th car with a modern nav/infotainment system.  I can think of only one that was worse. It relies almost exclusively on voice commands to run all of it. I’ve gone through the voice training exercises but it didn’t help for me. I’ve had cars with voice control for 10 yrs now but this system requires that you use it. Your passenger cannot help you out. I’ve had in car internet/WiFi in several cars since 2012, and my Toyota salesman was convincing in his claim that their cellphone based app would get me a lot of the same features. I drive a lot and use Nav heavily. I was depending on the app to serve as my seamless internet portal to provide an up to date database of POIs. I was disappointed to learn that the app/van require a sign in (username and password) ever time the car is turned on. Bluetooth calls work as you’d expect but the app log in makes it virtually useless. Prepare to use your phone for everything as though you bought a $20K car. My service manager said that he doesn’t use it either and suggested that I just use SIRI and Bluetooth it into the van’s speakers. The console is a horrible deep bin. A bin with no light, USB, or 12V socket. There is one USB slot on the dash but none in either glove box. There is a sizeable gap between the console and the dash. I still don’t know why. A sloppy purse receptacle? So if you are wanting to charge your phone you have to drape the cord across the gap to a cup holder. It’s only a matter of time before my dogs tear the whole thing out, USB slot and all. There is no convenient place to put your phone out of sight.  I was disappointed with the DVD and drop down monitor. Supposedly you can do split screen video on that wide screen. I think there is an HDMI input somewhere for it. Maybe I had a setting wrong but the dvd image was not widescreen format even though it was centered on the really wide monitor. The door armrests up front are horrible. 30 yrs later and exactly the same as my dad’s 1987 Camry. 1/4” of foam batting over a fiberboard armrest. Really uncomfortable after an hour of use. Plus, I drove my elbo through that Camry armrest eventually. :-)   The leather? on the center armrest is really cheap looking. I don’t use it for fear of destroying it before I resell the thing. The braking is alarmingly worse than my Q7 despite being1000lbs lighter. The acceleration is much worse too despite being lighter and having a much bigger V6. It does get better mileage at 20-22.5 mpg. Speaking of gas, I’m still not used to unlocking the fuel door from the inside. All of our cars since 2007 have used the same keyless entry that the doors use. My van has keyless entry but it is not connected to the fuel door. The transmission feels pretty sloppy when it’s searching for a gear sometimes. I don’t know if it’s wearing or just a poor transmission.  The weirdest issue I’ve had with it revolves around cargo. I brought 2X10s home from the hardware store. I was amazed to find that there was no handle or hook to secure the hatch, inside or out. I also transported two sheets of plywood in the van. (It was a selling point for me). My salesman told me plywood would fit and Plywood would fit in my sister’s 2006 Sienna. But I learned that my seat automatically moves all the way back when the car is put in park. I did not know this because I always have the seat all the way back. The seat pressed the plywood against the rear hatch breaking the latch.  The mechanics could not get the hatch open. I had to leave the van at the dealership, plywood still inside until they could order a new latch. $750.  Toyota would not provide a loaner because they didn’t want my two puppies in their cars. They did not have a shuttle so I had to wait 1 1/2 hrs for the parts cargo van to drive us home. Just a sad lack of customer service.",

Shortly after purchase we recognized that the manually operated sliding door is not getting closed. After multiple visits at dealer service garage they told us that we should multiple times slam the door until it is properly closed. The problem is, if the door is not ajar the interior lighting is remains permanently on and it drains the battery over night. This is the second battery, which is not working anymore and I must purchased the third.2)	Brakes: All four brakes (disk and path) needed to be replaced before 40,000 miles3)	Brake noise: During turning the brakes makes noise. The service garage changed the front brakes one more time after it was replaced before, but the problem didnt go away.4)	Safety built sensor damaged: The safety built warning light was blinking permanently until the sensor was replaced.5)	Air-conditioning: The air conditioning failed during a vacation trip. Toyota service told us that this was to be replaced anyhow due to a recall.6)	Under chassis plastic part fall of: Parts were replaced.7)	Tire Inflation Monitoring (TIM) signal: The left rear tire was replaced.

At least they have used a high quality bulb, because I was hoping the bulb will be damaged.

Additionally Sienna 2004 offered the Electronic Stability Control, which is an important safety feature. The price was higher compare to other minivan such as Honda Odyssey, but I was thinking that the premium price I am paying for this minivan is justified for the high quality of Toyota. At that time there was a quality image associate with Toyota. My wife, when she saw the Sienna for the first time she didnt like the appeal of it. She told me that this minivan has a charm like a used toothbrush. I encouraged her to buy this minivan for the good quality and now my wife never lessons to me for car buying decisions.",

It is annoying because you don't want to think about the car too much, especially a new one.Edit Mar. 2018: Constant ""battle"" with the check engine bulb. There have been 3 different codes since Sept 2017.",
-21.93968570635309,neu,neg," Pros: Performance, drive experienceCons: Reliability, cost to own. Either lease this car or make sure you can afford to be late to work -to drop it off at the repair shop a few times a year. Read the common issues on the web from most BMW owners.- Water Pump, Shift Display unit (sport mode), engine coils, cylinder head (known issue), bushings, differential, tensioner pulleyand on and on.Issues so common, I sent BMW corp the web links and they paid for the repairs. Car is not worth the trouble. Due diligence and experience has dissolved any brand affinity I have for BMW.Good luck with the techs -if the computer doesnt show them what's wrong they have to rely on trial and error",
-23.020926084907046,neg,neg, Radiator fluid will eventually leak into the transmission and destroy it. Be ready for high repair costs. Nissan does not stand behind this vehicle. Most dealers will get you to sign the purchased as is document right away even though they are aware of this factory defect.,
4.758285071866055,neg,neu, I wish they had a speedometer when going 45 miles per hour I could see the 45 digitally as a number. I had it on my last 2014 Chevy Equinox and now on my 2017 Chevy Colorado. My 2013 Chevy Corvette even had heads up display. Was it a mistake for Toyota not to include it on the 2017 RAV4 XLE. OTHERWISE a ok vehicle. by the way I sell Chevrolet and Nissan vehicle for a living.,
-23.448103861825643,neg,neg," I have had this car for 6 months. The mpg/epa fuel economy stated on the original sticker is way too high. I am lucky to get 17 mpg city driving; not on hwys. much at this time. Two local dealer's service reps. said they have heard similar, it is a national issue. The national call center is checking with them, but said not all of their cars will achieve even the minimum 21 mpg. One dealer reset the computer and tire pressure, still no difference. Both dealers said I have to drive it 5,000 mi. to see any better performance. That wasn't on the contract and I won't drive that much for the next 6 months. Plus the tank only holds max. 12 gallons.",
-17.16030431630611,neg,neg, I had problem with the roof rack peeling on my 2014 rouge. Since I use the vehicle for work I am past the mileage that is covered under the warranty. First asked the dealer and then filed a compliant with the consumer affair of Nissan USA. Of course they denied the claim to get it fixed since it out of warranty. This should not happen on 2.5 year old vehicle. This will be my first and last Nissan that I will own.👎👎👎Also this is know problem with other customers.[non-permissible content removed],
-10.183655090908246,pos,neg," I just rolled over 200,000 miles on my Quest and no problems. Squeaks a little. Sunroof leaks in a hard Florida rain. But this van has never had anything but 1 battery, several tires, and one brake job. I am so pleased that it has been so reliable! This van is powerful and fast! Every other car I have owned had problems by 75,000 miles. This thing still runs as smooth as the day I bought it. A/C control design takes forever to adjust. Center console did not last long, the powder finish disintegrated and it just looks horrible but is very expensive to replace. Huge and comfy interior. I have had none of the mechanical or interior problems mentioned??  I have 3 kids and use the van A LOT!!",
-19.342476349215644,pos,neg," I bought the car brand new in 2011. I love how this car drives.  Super fun and sporty. Hands down there is nothing on the market to compare to this little turbo six. Hence the love part. The hate part is the water pump going out with only 45,000 miles on it costing me over $1000. to fix.  Constantly having battery problems with it in the cold winter, tail lights going out. The mechanic told me to save my money cause that""s how BMW's are.  It's a high maintenance car but a blast to drive.  It will be going down the road soon and will not be replaced by another BMW. I'm just not into the high cost of the maintenance regardless of how fun the car is to drive.",

Dashboard is well laid out and illuminated. The drive is quiet and smooth. The engine has plenty of power at all speeds due to a very refined engine and transmission. Plenty of room for the family, their gadgets and their drinks! This van also has a great many safety features which anyone would appreciate! ",
